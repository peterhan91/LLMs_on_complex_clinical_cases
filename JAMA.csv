https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2809109,"A 42-year-old woman with asthma, seasonal allergies, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma presented to the dermatology clinic for rash and poor wound healing 2 weeks after bilateral mastectomy. Five days after surgery, the patient noted erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites (Figure 1). Two days later, she developed an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her trunk and upper and lower extremities. A skin swab was sent for bacterial culture, and she was prescribed cefadroxil (500 mg twice daily for 1 week). The skin swab bacterial culture result was negative, and her skin findings did not improve with antibiotics. The patient reported having a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site', 'B. Prescribe acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days)', 'C. Start topical steroids and perform a skin patch test', 'D. Treat with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days)']",C,A,"The correct answer would be to ""Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site"". 

The patient's symptoms of erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites, along with the development of an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her trunk and upper and lower extremities, are concerning for a possible skin condition or infection. The fact that her symptoms did not improve with antibiotics and her skin swab bacterial culture result was negative suggests that the cause of her symptoms may not be bacterial. A skin biopsy would allow for histopathological examination of the affected skin, which could help identify the cause of her symptoms.

The patient's history of a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation also supports the need for further investigation. 

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site. The patient's symptoms of erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage, along with the development of an erythematous papulovesicular rash on the trunk and extremities, suggest a possible allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The fact that the patient had a similar episode after laparoscopy further supports this possibility. A skin biopsy would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Prescribing acyclovir would not be appropriate in this case as there is no evidence to suggest a viral infection. Starting topical steroids and performing a skin patch test may be considered if an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, but a skin biopsy would provide more definitive information. Treating with doxycycline would not be appropriate as there is no evidence to suggest a bacterial infection.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",A,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site. The patient has presented with symptoms of erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the incision sites, which could indicate a possible infection or other skin condition. A skin biopsy would help to determine the underlying cause of the skin findings and guide appropriate treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site.""",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Prescribe acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days).

The patient's history of recurrent rash and delayed wound healing after surgery, along with the presence of erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites, suggests a possible diagnosis of wound herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The negative bacterial culture result supports this diagnosis, as HSV infections can mimic bacterial infections.

Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against HSV infections. It is commonly used to treat herpes zoster (shingles) and herpes simplex (cold sores), as well as HSV infections in immunocompromised patients. In this case, acyclovir may help to reduce the severity and duration of the rash, promote wound healing, and prevent further complications.

It is important to note that a skin biopsy (option 1) may also be considered to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the patient's symptoms do not improve with antiviral treatment. However, given the patient's history and clinical presentation, it is likely that acyclovir therapy will be effective in managing the HSV infection.

Regarding the question of whether the patient's medical images are necessary, the answer is True. Images of the patient's skin lesions and mastectomy incision sites would be helpful in assessing the severity of the rash and monitoring the response to treatment.

Justification:

* Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against HSV infections, which is suggested by the patient's history and clinical presentation.
* A skin biopsy may be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not necessary at this stage, given the patient's history and clinical presentation.
* Medical images are necessary to assess the severity of the rash and monitor the response to treatment.",jama
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807531,"A 67-year-old man with thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls presented to the emergency department with 2 months of left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in his left upper extremity. Ten years prior to presentation, he underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, he had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in his proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of his left shoulder. His complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Obtain MRI of the left shoulder', 'B. Order serum tumor marker testing', 'C. Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery', 'D. Perform an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration']",A,A,"The correct next step would be to ""Obtain MRI of the left shoulder"". 

The patient's symptoms and the radiographic findings suggest a severe local problem in the left shoulder. The complete absence of the humeral head and the well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus are not typical findings in arthritis or other common shoulder disorders. These findings suggest a more severe local disease process, such as infection, tumor, or a rare condition like Gorham-Stout disease (also known as vanishing bone disease). An MRI of the shoulder would provide more detailed information about the soft tissues, bone marrow, and the extent of the disease process, which is crucial for planning further management.

Serum tumor marker testing is not the first step in the evaluation of a potential bone tumor. Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery would be premature without a clear diagnosis. An urgent left shoulder joint aspiration might be considered if there was a concern for septic arthritis, but this patient's normal inflammatory markers and the chronicity of his symptoms make this less likely.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration.

The patient's symptoms, including shoulder pain, stiffness, reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in the left upper extremity, along with the radiographic findings of complete absence of the left humeral head and periarticular calcification, suggest a possible diagnosis of destructive arthritis of the left shoulder joint. This can be further confirmed by performing a joint aspiration, which would allow for analysis of the synovial fluid for inflammatory markers, crystals, and infection.

Obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder may provide additional information about the extent of joint destruction and soft tissue involvement, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case.

Ordering serum tumor marker testing would not be indicated at this point, as there is no evidence to suggest a neoplastic process causing the patient's symptoms.

Referring the patient for orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery may be considered as a treatment option, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.

Justification: The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiographic results strongly suggest destructive arthritis of the left shoulder joint. Performing a joint aspiration would provide valuable diagnostic information and guide further management.

The question above does not require the corresponding medical image.",A,The correct answer is: Obtain MRI of the left shoulder,A,"Based on the patient's history of thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls, along with the physical examination findings of mild tenderness, reduced range of motion, and atrophic left scapular muscles, it is likely that the patient has a shoulder injury or condition that is causing the left shoulder pain, stiffness, and numbness. The absence of the left humeral head and the presence of a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification on the left shoulder radiograph further support this possibility.

Therefore, the next step would be to obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to further evaluate the extent of the injury or condition and to determine the appropriate course of treatment.

Answer: Obtain MRI of the left shoulder.

Justification:

* The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a shoulder injury or condition that may not be visible on a chest radiograph.
* An MRI scan can provide detailed images of the soft tissues and bones of the shoulder, which can help to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms and guide treatment.
* The presence of a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification on the left shoulder radiograph suggests that the patient may have a chronic condition that has been present for some time, which may not be visible on a chest radiograph taken 2 years prior.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807957,"A 73-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Raynaud disease but no history of cigarette smoking presented to the emergency department with 4 weeks of dysphagia and a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight loss over 3 months. He had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia but reported a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. The patient had been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months due to infiltrates on a chest radiograph. He reported no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US. At presentation, his heart rate and blood pressure were normal, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest (Figure, left panel) and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 14.3 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-9.1 × 103/μL); creatine kinase level, 2060 U/L (34.40 μkat/L) (reference, 44-196 U/L [0.73-3.27 μkat/L]), aldolase level, 18 U/L (0.30 μkat/L) (reference, <8 U/L [<0.13 μkat/L]), C-reactive protein level, 30 mg/L (reference, <8 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 35 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h). Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings were positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. A barium swallow study showed no visualized aspiration. Endoscopy revealed clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities (Figure, right panel).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Arrange a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy', 'B. Check an antisynthetase antibody panel', 'C. Perform a quadriceps muscle biopsy', 'D. Prescribe 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily)']",B,B,"The correct answer is: Check an antisynthetase antibody panel.

The patient's presentation of dysphagia, weight loss, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, maculopapular rash, and bibasilar crackles, along with the laboratory findings of elevated white blood cell count, creatine kinase, aldolase, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and positive antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings, are suggestive of an autoimmune condition, possibly antisynthetase syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by interstitial lung disease, myositis, and often Raynaud's phenomenon, which the patient has a history of. The antisynthetase antibody panel would help confirm this diagnosis.

A percutaneous lung tissue biopsy or a quadriceps muscle biopsy could potentially provide useful information, but these are invasive procedures and should be considered only after less invasive tests have been performed. Prednisone could potentially be beneficial if this is indeed an autoimmune condition, but it would be premature to prescribe it without a more definitive diagnosis.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The information provided in the text is sufficient to make a decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to check an antisynthetase antibody panel. 

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of a maculopapular rash and bibasilar crackles, raise suspicion for an underlying autoimmune condition. The positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) immunofluorescent assay further supports this possibility. Antisynthetase antibodies are associated with a group of autoimmune diseases known as antisynthetase syndrome, which can present with interstitial lung disease, myositis, and other systemic manifestations. Checking an antisynthetase antibody panel can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

A percutaneous lung tissue biopsy may be considered if the pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities seen on chest CT are suspicious for an infectious process or malignancy. However, given the patient's clinical presentation and positive ANA, an autoimmune etiology is more likely, making the antisynthetase antibody panel a more appropriate initial step.

Performing a quadriceps muscle biopsy may be indicated if there is a high suspicion for an underlying inflammatory myopathy, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. However, the patient's symptoms and findings are more suggestive of an autoimmune connective tissue disease rather than a primary myopathy.

Prescribing prednisone (60 mg daily) may be considered if there is a high suspicion for an autoimmune condition and immediate treatment is warranted. However, further diagnostic evaluation with the antisynthetase antibody panel would be beneficial before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.

Justification for the need for a medical image: False. The information provided in the question is sufficient to make a clinical decision without the need for a corresponding medical image.",B,Check an antisynthetase antibody panel,B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step would be to Check an antisynthetase antibody panel.

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, and the laboratory results of an elevated white blood cell count, creatine kinase level, aldolase level, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggest a possible diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder. The positive antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings support this possibility.

Checking an antisynthetase antibody panel would help to confirm the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, which can cause the symptoms and laboratory abnormalities described. If the antisynthetase antibody panel is positive, it would support the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder and guide further management and treatment.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Check an antisynthetase antibody panel.

Justify:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible autoimmune disorder, and checking an antisynthetase antibody panel would help to confirm this diagnosis. The panel includes tests for antibodies against various proteins, including histidyl-tRNA synthetase, threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and alanyl-tRNA synthetase, which are commonly targeted in autoimmune disorders. A positive result on the antisynthetase antibody panel would support the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder and guide further management and treatment.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2806233,"A 70-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a pruritic exanthem that began on his scalp and face and spread across most of his body over a 2-month period. The patient had no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. He had no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, his temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body with several patches of unaffected skin on his trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure (Figure). He was referred to the emergency department, where laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated with intravenous fluids and daily wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) applied to his trunk, arms, and legs, followed by a layer of warm, damp gauze and dry, cotton pajamas.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Order a myositis-specific autoantibody panel', 'B. Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies', 'C. Order testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody', 'D. Order testing for HLA-B27']",B,B,"The correct answer is: Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies.

The patient's presentation is consistent with erythrodermic psoriasis, a severe form of psoriasis that can be life-threatening due to high-output cardiac failure and thermoregulatory dysfunction. Erythrodermic psoriasis is characterized by generalized erythema and scaling involving more than 90% of the body surface area. It can occur de novo or in a patient with a history of psoriasis that suddenly worsens and involves the entire skin surface. The patient's lack of a history of psoriasis does not exclude this diagnosis because erythrodermic psoriasis can be the initial presentation of psoriasis in a small percentage of patients. 

A skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies is the next best step to confirm the diagnosis and rule out cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which can present similarly but requires a different treatment approach. 

The other options are not as relevant in this case. A myositis-specific autoantibody panel would be considered if there were symptoms of muscle weakness or inflammation, which are not present here. Anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody testing is used in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, which does not match this patient's presentation. HLA-B27 testing is used in the diagnosis of certain rheumatologic diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, which also does not match this patient's presentation.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is False.",B,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies. This patient's presentation is consistent with Sézary syndrome, a leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Sézary syndrome typically presents with pruritic exanthem, erythroderma, and lymphadenopathy. The presence of waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of the hands and feet, thickened onycholytic nails, and severe ectropion are also suggestive of this diagnosis. Skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies can help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the presence of clonal T cells in the skin.

Ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel would not be appropriate in this case as there are no symptoms or findings suggestive of myositis.

Ordering testing for anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody would not be appropriate in this case as there are no symptoms or findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus.

Ordering testing for HLA-B27 would not be appropriate in this case as there are no symptoms or findings suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis or other HLA-B27-associated conditions.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,The correct answer is: Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies,D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most appropriate next step would be to Order testing for HLA-B27.

The patient's presentation of a pruritic exanthem with scaly papules and plaques, as well as the presence of waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet, and thickened, onycholytic nails, suggests a diagnosis of psoriasis. HLA-B27 is a genetic marker that is commonly associated with psoriasis, and testing for it can help support the diagnosis.

Additionally, the patient's history of no recent viral or bacterial infection, and no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem, makes it less likely that the condition is caused by an infection or a medication reaction.

Therefore, Ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel, Obtaining skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies, or Ordering testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody, would not be the most appropriate next steps at this time.

He lived in rural China and had close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep. His blood pressure was 93/60 mm Hg; heart rate, 100/min; respiratory rate, 26/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right hemithorax. His abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. His white blood cell count was 8000/μL, with 25.8% eosinophils (reference range, 0%-9%). C-reactive protein level and results from tuberculin skin test, interferon-γ release assay, nucleic acid amplification testing for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, and HIV antibody testing were normal. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a ruptured 10 × 9 × 5–cm right upper lobe pulmonary cyst compressing the right main bronchus and 3 liver cysts (Figure 1).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Check stool for Echinococcus granulosus eggs', 'B. Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies', 'C. Order a lung biopsy', 'D. Perform a liver biopsy']",B,B,"The correct answer is: Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies.

The patient's symptoms, history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, and the CT scan findings of a large pulmonary cyst and liver cysts are highly suggestive of a hydatid disease, which is caused by the Echinococcus granulosus parasite. Serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies is a non-invasive and effective method to confirm the diagnosis.

Stool examination for Echinococcus eggs is not a reliable diagnostic method because the eggs are not always present or may be difficult to distinguish from other parasites. Lung and liver biopsies are invasive procedures and carry a risk of cyst rupture and anaphylaxis, so they should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serologic testing for Echinococcus granulosus antibodies. 

Echinococcus granulosus is a parasitic tapeworm that can cause cystic echinococcosis, a condition characterized by the formation of cysts in various organs, including the liver and lungs. The patient's history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, along with the presence of liver cysts on the CT scan, raises suspicion for this parasitic infection.

Serologic testing for Echinococcus granulosus antibodies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), can help confirm the diagnosis. It is a non-invasive and relatively simple test that can detect specific antibodies produced in response to the infection.

A lung biopsy or liver biopsy may be considered if the serologic testing is inconclusive or if there is a need for histopathological confirmation. However, given the characteristic imaging findings and the potential risks associated with invasive procedures, serologic testing would be the initial step.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies. This is because the patient's clinical presentation and exposure history suggest a possible infection with Echinococcus granulosus, a parasitic tapeworm commonly found in dogs, cattle, and sheep. The presence of a ruptured pulmonary cyst and liver cysts on CT scan further supports this suspicion. Serologic testing can help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment. Ordering a lung or liver biopsy may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the first-line approach and should be reserved for situations where the diagnosis is uncertain or the disease has progressed significantly. Checking stool for Echinococcus eggs may also be helpful in some cases, but it is not the most immediate concern in this situation.",B,"Based on the given information, I would choose option B, Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies.

The patient's symptoms of fever, productive cough, and lethargy, along with the physical examination findings of absent breath sounds on the right hemithorax and liver cysts, suggest a possible diagnosis of echinococcosis, a parasitic infection caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The patient's history of living in rural China and having close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis, as it can detect the presence of antibodies against the parasite in the patient's blood. This test is particularly useful in cases where the patient has a high likelihood of exposure to the parasite and presents with symptoms consistent with echinococcosis.

Option A, Check stool for Echinococcus granulosus eggs, may also be useful in diagnosing echinococcosis, but it is not as specific as serologic testing and may not detect the presence of the parasite in the early stages of infection.

Option C, Order a lung biopsy, may be necessary if the diagnosis is still uncertain after serologic testing, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Option D, Perform a liver biopsy, is not necessary at this time, as the patient's liver cysts are likely a result of the echinococcosis infection and do not require a separate biopsy.

Justify: True. A thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed, which showed a ruptured pulmonary cyst compressing the right main bronchus and 3 liver cysts.

Perform random skin biopsies', 'D. Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins']",B,D,"The correct next step would be to ""Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins"". 

The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, bilateral edema, and unintended weight loss, along with the laboratory findings of elevated troponin and brain-type natriuretic peptide levels, suggest a cardiac issue, possibly heart failure. The numbness in the toes and weakness in ankle plantar flexion could be due to peripheral neuropathy. 

These symptoms, along with the findings of elevated liver enzymes and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, could be indicative of a systemic disease such as amyloidosis, which is a condition where abnormal proteins called amyloids build up and can damage organs. Amyloidosis often affects the heart, kidneys, liver, and nerves. 

A 24-hour urine test for monoclonal proteins is a non-invasive way to screen for the presence of abnormal proteins, which could support a diagnosis of amyloidosis. If the test is positive, further confirmatory tests such as a biopsy may be needed.

The need for a corresponding medical image for this question is <False> as the clinical scenario and laboratory findings provide sufficient information to make the next step in management.",D,"Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate next step would be to order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins. This is because the patient's symptoms, including weight loss, chest pain, and shortness of breath, along with the presence of edema and abnormal laboratory values (elevated troponin and brain-type natriuretic peptide), suggest the possibility of a systemic disease process. The presence of monoclonal proteins in the urine can indicate conditions such as multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias, which can present with a wide range of symptoms including neuropathy (toe numbness) and cardiac involvement (elevated troponin and brain-type natriuretic peptide). Therefore, further evaluation with 24-hour urine testing is warranted to assess for the presence of monoclonal proteins.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins

The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a possibility of multiple myeloma. To further investigate this suspicion, the appropriate next step is to order a 24-hour urine test for monoclonal proteins. This test can help identify the presence of monoclonal proteins, which can be a key indicator of multiple myeloma. Bone marrow biopsy, genetic testing, and random skin biopsies are not the most appropriate next steps in this case, as they do not directly help in diagnosing multiple myeloma.",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step would be to Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins.

The patient's history of chest pain and shortness of breath, along with the physical examination findings of edema and hypoesthesia, suggest the possibility of a cardiovascular condition. The laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin and brain-type natriuretic peptide, which are markers of cardiac damage and dysfunction. Additionally, the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase are mildly elevated, which could indicate liver damage or dysfunction.

Ordering 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins would help to rule out the possibility of multiple myeloma, a condition that can cause M protein production and lead to symptoms such as bone pain, numbness, and weight loss. The patient's history of lumbar spinal stenosis increases the likelihood of a neoplastic process, and the presence of M protein in the urine would support this diagnosis.

Performing a bone marrow biopsy or random skin biopsies would not be the most appropriate next step, as they are invasive procedures that may not provide the necessary information to diagnose the underlying condition.

Results of testing for rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Examination of punch biopsy samples from 2 plaques on his back revealed granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. This includes the skin lesions, numbness and paresthesia in the affected areas, inability to fully extend fingers, thickened auricular and ulnar nerves, claw-hand deformity, and foot drop. The granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes found in the biopsy also support this diagnosis.

However, the tests for Mycobacterium leprae, the bacteria that causes leprosy, were negative. This could be due to the fact that M. leprae is difficult to culture and often does not show up on standard acid-fast bacilli stains or mycobacterial PCR testing. Therefore, sending the skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for specialized PCR testing would be the next best step to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are not as appropriate. Incubating the skin biopsy specimen on chocolate agar is not useful because M. leprae cannot be cultured on standard media. Obtaining serologic testing for M. leprae phenolic glycolipid 1 is not typically done for diagnostic purposes. Starting treatment with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine would be premature without a confirmed diagnosis.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1. This is because the patient's symptoms, skin lesions, and neurological findings are consistent with leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. Serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1 can help confirm the diagnosis of leprosy.

The other options listed are not the most appropriate next steps in this case. Incubating the skin biopsy specimen on chocolate agar would be more relevant if there were suspicion of a bacterial infection, but the clinical presentation and biopsy findings do not suggest a bacterial etiology. Sending the skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen's Disease Program for PCR testing may be considered if the serologic testing is inconclusive, but it is not the initial step. Treating with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine is the standard treatment for leprosy, but it should be initiated after confirming the diagnosis.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Obtain serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1.

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest the possibility of leprosy (Hansen's disease). Although the initial tests for M. leprae were negative, the presence of granulomatous dermatitis and the patient's immigration history from Samoa, where the prevalence of leprosy is higher, indicate that further testing is warranted. Serologic testing for M. leprae phenolic glycolipid 1 can help confirm the diagnosis.",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most appropriate next step would be to treat the patient with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine.

The patient's symptoms of numbness, paresthesia, and claw-hand deformity, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral palpable thickened auricular and ulnar nerves, foot drop bilaterally, and decreased sensation to temperature over the areas of skin plaque, are consistent with neurological involvement. The negative results for rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor suggest that the patient does not have a autoimmune disorder. The granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes found on biopsy suggest a diagnosis of leprosy.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and immune system dysfunction. The patient's history of immigration from Samoa, where leprosy is endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Treatment for leprosy typically involves a combination of antibiotics, including dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine. These medications are effective in killing M. leprae and preventing further nerve damage.

Therefore, the best next step would be to treat the patient with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine, and closely monitor their response to treatment.

His temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue (Figure). He reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Measure serum cortisol level', 'B. Perform a tongue biopsy', 'C. Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care', 'D. Stop cefazolin']",C,C,"The correct answer is: Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

The patient's black tongue discoloration is likely a condition known as black hairy tongue (BHT). BHT is a benign condition characterized by elongation and hyperpigmentation of the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue. It is often associated with poor oral hygiene, antibiotic use, and decreased salivary flow. The patient's recent antibiotic use (cefazolin) for his shoulder infection could have disrupted the normal oral flora, promoting overgrowth of pigment-producing bacteria or yeast.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Measuring serum cortisol level is not relevant to the patient's presentation. A tongue biopsy is not necessary as BHT is a clinical diagnosis and the patient is asymptomatic. Stopping cefazolin is not indicated as it is effectively treating the patient's shoulder infection and BHT is a benign condition that resolves with improved oral hygiene.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to provide reassurance and prescribe oral care. The patient's asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of the tongue is likely to be a harmless condition known as black hairy tongue. This condition is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria or yeast in the mouth, leading to the accumulation of dead skin cells on the papillae of the tongue. It is often associated with poor oral hygiene, tobacco use, or certain medications, but in this case, the patient denies any of these risk factors.

Measuring serum cortisol levels or performing a tongue biopsy would not be necessary in this situation as the patient's symptoms are benign and do not suggest any underlying systemic condition or malignancy. Stopping cefazolin would not be indicated either, as the patient is being treated for a confirmed infection with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and should continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,"The correct answer is: Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

Explanation: The patient has developed a black tongue discoloration, which is a known side effect of cefazolin therapy. It is usually asymptomatic and resolves on its own after discontinuation of the medication. Therefore, the next best step is to provide reassurance to the patient and prescribe good oral care, including mouthwash and brushing, to help alleviate the symptoms. There is no need to measure serum cortisol levels or perform a tongue biopsy, as this is a benign and self-limiting condition. However, it is important to monitor the patient's symptoms and ensure that they do not worsen or become persistent. If the patient's symptoms do not improve or if they develop other concerning symptoms, further evaluation may be necessary.",A,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to measure serum cortisol level.

The patient's symptoms of fever, shoulder pain, and tongue discoloration, along with the laboratory results of elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase, suggest a possible diagnosis of sepsis or infection. The fact that the patient has a history of smoking and alcohol consumption increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The patient's recent development of asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue, which he reported as not being present prior to hospitalization, suggests a possible diagnosis of lingual melanosis. Lingual melanosis is a benign condition that is associated with smoking and alcohol consumption.

Measuring serum cortisol level would help to rule out other potential causes of lingual melanosis, such as adrenal insufficiency, which can cause similar symptoms. Additionally, cortisol levels can help to assess the patient's overall health status and response to stress.

Performing a tongue biopsy would not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a more likely diagnosis of sepsis or infection, and the patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption increases the likelihood of lingual melanosis.

Providing reassurance and prescribing oral care would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and would not be appropriate at this time.

Stopping cefazolin therapy would not be appropriate, as the patient has already developed symptoms suggestive of sepsis or infection, and cefazolin is an appropriate treatment for this condition.

Therefore, measuring serum cortisol level would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's care.

The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a possible bowel obstruction, which is a surgical emergency. However, her hypotension and tachycardia indicate that she is in shock, likely due to sepsis from the bowel obstruction. Her elevated creatinine level suggests acute kidney injury, likely due to hypoperfusion from the shock. Her hypokalemia should also be corrected. Therefore, she needs aggressive fluid resuscitation in the ICU to stabilize her hemodynamics before proceeding to surgery.

Administering barium through the nasogastric tube is not appropriate because it can cause aspiration in a patient with bowel obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is not indicated because there is no evidence of biliary or pancreatic disease. An emergency explorative laparotomy without prior resuscitation could be risky given the patient's unstable condition.

The elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and abnormal renal function also support the need for urgent surgical intervention.

Administering barium through the nasogastric tube to evaluate for bowel obstruction may not be appropriate in this case, as it could potentially worsen the patient's condition if there is a perforation or obstruction.

Ordering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not suggestive of biliary or pancreatic pathology.

Planning for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) may delay necessary treatment in this critically ill patient. Immediate surgical exploration is warranted given the patient's unstable hemodynamic status and concerning clinical presentation.

Additionally, the patient has derangements in potassium and creatinine levels, which could be indicative of acute kidney injury. Given the patient's unstable hemodynamic status with hypotension and tachycardia, it is important to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids in the ICU before considering surgical intervention.

The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of a distended, tympanic, and slightly tender abdomen, suggest the possibility of a bowel obstruction or gallstone-related pancreatitis. The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and creatinine level, indicating inflammation and possible kidney dysfunction.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed information about the biliary tree and pancreas, allowing for the evaluation of gallstones, strictures, and pancreatitis. It is the most appropriate test to perform at this stage, as it can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Administering barium through the nasogastric tube (Option 1) may also be useful in evaluating for bowel obstruction, but it is not as specific as MRCP for evaluating the biliary tree and pancreas.

Obtaining a PCR panel for gastrointestinal pathogens would allow for the detection of common bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens that could be causing the patient's symptoms.

Checking stool for ova and parasites would be a reasonable consideration, but given the patient's age and the duration of symptoms, a broader PCR panel would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

Ordering measurement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. ANCA is typically associated with autoimmune vasculitis, which does not align with the patient's symptoms and history.

The patient's presentation of spontaneous blistering without any history of trauma or exposure to extreme temperatures or chemicals, along with the presence of hyperpigmented macules and tense bullae, suggests a possible dermatological condition. The absence of erythema or edema around the bullae also indicates that this is not likely an infectious process, which makes the option of treating with oral cephalexin less likely. 

The patient's long-standing poorly controlled diabetes (as indicated by the high blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels) could have led to diabetic bullous disease (also known as bullosis diabeticorum), a rare skin condition associated with diabetes. However, other blistering diseases such as bullous pemphigoid or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita could also present similarly. 

A skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Aspiration of the bullae could potentially introduce infection and starting oral prednisone without a confirmed diagnosis could lead to unnecessary immunosuppression.

A skin biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis by examining the histopathological features and performing direct immunofluorescence to detect the presence of autoantibodies. This would guide further management and treatment decisions.

Aspiration of the bullae with a sterile needle and covering with a clean dressing may be considered in cases where there is suspicion of infection or to relieve discomfort, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide treatment for an autoimmune blistering disorder.

The patient's symptoms of spontaneous blisters on the right lower extremity, along with the presence of hyperpigmented macules on the anterior lower legs and tense bullae on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes, suggest a possible diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. This is a rare autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin.

A skin biopsy would allow for a histopathological examination of the skin tissue, which can help to confirm the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Direct immunofluorescence can also be performed on the skin tissue to identify the presence of autoantibodies and complement deposits, which are characteristic of the disease.

Starting oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d) without a definitive diagnosis could potentially mask the symptoms and make it more difficult to diagnose the underlying condition. Treating with oral cephalexin for 7 days may be appropriate if there is a secondary bacterial infection, but it would not address the underlying cause of the blisters.

However, the normal levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) make it less likely that this is a malignant tumor. A diagnostic laparoscopy would allow for a direct visual examination of the mass and the surrounding tissues, and would also allow for a biopsy to be taken if necessary. This would provide more information about the nature of the mass and guide further treatment.

Obtaining a needle biopsy or ordering percutaneous drainage without first visually examining the mass could potentially lead to complications, such as spreading the disease if it is malignant, or causing an infection. A laparotomy with removal of the mass would be too invasive at this stage without a clear diagnosis.

A diagnostic laparoscopy would provide visualization of the abdominal cavity and allow for biopsy of the mass, which would help to establish a definitive diagnosis. This approach is minimally invasive and carries less risk than a laparotomy. The normal laboratory test results do not provide a clear diagnosis, and a diagnostic laparoscopy would provide more information than a needle biopsy or percutaneous drainage.",jama

These findings developed over the prior week and did not improve after treatment with 3 days of oral cefuroxime. The patient reported no sore throat, dysphagia, hoarse voice, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, night sweats, weight loss, rash, or genital, rectal, or oral ulcers over the past 6 months. He was taking no regular daily medications, did not smoke cigarettes, and had no history of oral trauma. Over the prior 6 months, he reported sexual contact with 1 male partner. Physical examination revealed irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils (Figure 1) and nontender bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy.

The patient's symptoms, including the gray-white ulcers on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils, as well as the bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, are suggestive of a syphilis infection, which is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The patient's reported sexual contact with a male partner also increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection such as syphilis. 

A serologic test for Treponema pallidum would help confirm this diagnosis. The other options, such as performing a biopsy of the plaque, prescribing oral amoxicillin, or starting topical nystatin, may not be as immediately helpful in this case. A biopsy could be considered if the serologic test results are inconclusive, but it would not be the first step. Amoxicillin is not the first-line treatment for syphilis, and nystatin is an antifungal medication, which would not be effective against a bacterial infection.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description provided is quite detailed. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's presentation of gray-white ulcers on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils, along with bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum. This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with syphilis, which is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Syphilis can present with oral manifestations such as ulcers and lymphadenopathy. Serologic testing will help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Performing a biopsy of the gray-white plaque may be considered if the serologic test results are inconclusive or if there is a need for histopathological confirmation. However, it is not the initial step in the evaluation of this patient.

Prescribing oral amoxicillin would not be the appropriate choice in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not suggestive of a bacterial infection that would respond to amoxicillin.

Starting topical nystatin would also not be the appropriate choice, as nystatin is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections such as oral thrush. The patient's presentation is not consistent with oral thrush, and therefore, topical nystatin would not be indicated.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",B,"Based on the patient's presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer. A biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment. Obtaining serologic test results for Treponema pallidum (choice A) may be appropriate if the patient had a history of genital ulcers or other symptoms consistent with syphilis, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings.

She had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. She reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week.

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of porphyria, a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the nervous system and skin. The symptoms include abdominal pain, which can be severe, and can come and go, lasting for several days or longer. These symptoms can be triggered by certain medications, including oral contraceptives, which the patient is taking. 

The urine porphobilinogen level is a test used to diagnose porphyria. If the level is elevated, it indicates that the patient may have this condition. 

The other options are not as relevant based on the patient's symptoms and history. Gabapentin is a medication used to treat nerve pain and seizures, but there's no indication of these conditions in the patient's history. Assessing celiac artery flow and injecting a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness are procedures that would be more relevant for conditions involving the gastrointestinal system or localized pain, which the patient does not appear to have based on the information provided.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to assess celiac artery flow. The patient's symptoms of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, which has developed gradually over a 3-day period, along with the history of intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week, suggest a possible vascular etiology.

The celiac artery supplies blood to the upper abdominal organs, including the stomach, liver, and spleen. Assessing celiac artery flow can help determine if there is any compromise or obstruction in the blood supply to these organs, which could be causing the abdominal pain.

Administering gabapentin would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as it is primarily used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and not specifically indicated for the evaluation of abdominal pain.

Injecting a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness may provide temporary pain relief, but it would not address the underlying cause of the pain or help in making a definitive diagnosis.

Measuring urine porphobilinogen level would be more relevant if there were symptoms suggestive of acute intermittent porphyria, such as abdominal pain associated with neurologic symptoms, but this is not described in the patient's presentation.

Justification for the need for a corresponding medical image: False. The information provided does not indicate the need for a specific medical image at this point.",D,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to measure the urine porphobilinogen level.

The patient's history of similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week over the previous 2 years also supports this possibility.

Assessing celiac artery flow would help to determine if there is any compromise in blood flow to the abdominal organs, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. This would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it would help to identify or rule out a potentially life-threatening condition.

Administering gabapentin (option 1) may be appropriate for managing chronic pain, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Injecting a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness (option 3) may provide temporary relief of pain, but it would not diagnose or treat the underlying condition. Measuring urine porphobilinogen level (option 4) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Perform coronary angiography', 'D. Reorder troponin T measurement in 3 hours']",C,P,"The correct answer is: Perform coronary angiography.

The patient's symptoms of chest pain and diaphoresis, along with elevated troponin T levels, are suggestive of unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). These are types of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention. The patient's smoking history also puts him at a higher risk for coronary artery disease.

Coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease and is typically performed in patients with suspected ACS who have a high risk of adverse outcomes. It allows for direct visualization of the coronary arteries and can identify any blockages or narrowing that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

The other options are less appropriate. Discharging the patient home with outpatient cardiology follow-up would not provide the immediate intervention needed for ACS. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram could be used to evaluate for coronary artery disease, but it is less accurate than coronary angiography and would not be the best choice in this situation. Reordering the troponin T measurement in 3 hours could help confirm the diagnosis of ACS, but it would not provide any information about the location or severity of the coronary artery disease.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered, so the answer is False.",C,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of chest pain and diaphoresis that resolved spontaneously. He has a significant smoking history and elevated troponin T levels. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment depression in leads V1-V4.

Given the patient's symptoms, risk factors (smoking), and elevated troponin T levels, the most appropriate next step would be to perform coronary angiography. This is because the patient's presentation is consistent with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease and determining the need for revascularization.

Discharging the patient home with outpatient cardiology follow-up would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient has ongoing symptoms and elevated troponin levels, indicating a potential cardiac event.

Ordering a dobutamine stress echocardiogram may be considered in stable patients with intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and elevated troponin levels suggest an acute coronary syndrome, making coronary angiography a more appropriate choice.

Reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours may be done to assess for dynamic changes in troponin levels, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide immediate management.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,The correct answer is: Perform coronary angiography,B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Order a dobutamine stress echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms of chest pain and diaphoresis, along with his history of smoking and elevated troponin T levels, suggest a potential cardiac issue. While the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) does not show any obvious abnormalities, a dobutamine stress echocardiogram would provide additional information on the heart's function and help to identify any potential issues.

A dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that uses ultrasound imaging to evaluate the heart's function during physical activity, in this case, dobutamine stimulation. It can help to identify any areas of the heart that may be affected by coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions.

Therefore, option 2: Order a dobutamine stress echocardiogram, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation and management.

Justify:

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a potential cardiac issue, and a dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that can help to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. The test can provide valuable information on the heart's function and help to guide further management.

Reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours (option 4) may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While it is important to monitor the patient's troponin levels, a dobutamine stress echocardiogram would provide more comprehensive information on the heart's function and help to guide management decisions.

Performing coronary angiography (option 3) may be necessary if the dobutamine stress echocardiogram suggests coronary artery disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Discharging the patient home with outpatient cardiology follow-up (option 1) may not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and history. While outpatient follow-up may be necessary, it is important to first evaluate the patient's condition thoroughly to ensure that there is no immediate risk to his health.

The patient's symptoms suggest a condition known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which is a severe mucocutaneous reaction, often to a medication or infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of SJS in children and often presents with persistent cough and fever, as in this case. The vesiculobullous lesions on the palms and soles, as well as the erosions on the lips, oral mucosa, and anal mucosa, are characteristic of SJS. 

The other options are less likely based on the presented symptoms. Behçet disease is a rare, chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder and the pathergy test is not specific to this case. An echocardiogram would be more appropriate if there were symptoms suggesting heart disease. Monkeypox virus would be considered if the patient had a history of exposure, but it's less likely in this case.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms, including persistent fever, cough, vesiculobullous lesions on the palms and soles, erythema, vesicles and erosions on the face, trunk, and limbs, erosions on the lips and oral mucosa, eyelid swelling, and blisters on the anal mucosa, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in children and can also cause extrapulmonary manifestations, such as mucocutaneous lesions. The patient's symptoms, including the prolonged fever, cough, and skin lesions, are consistent with a possible Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels can help confirm the diagnosis.

The appearance of vesiculobullous lesions on the palms and soles, followed by erythema, vesicles, and erosions on the face, trunk, and limbs, as well as erosions on the lips and oral mucosa, eyelid swelling, and blisters on the anal mucosa, are all consistent with the symptoms of monkeypox. Therefore, it is important to carry out a test for monkeypox virus to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.",D,"Based on the symptoms described, the most appropriate next step would be to test for monkeypox virus. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and skin lesions, as well as the presence of vesicles and erosions on the palms and soles, are consistent with monkeypox infection. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of underlying medical conditions suggest that monkeypox is a more likely diagnosis than Behçet disease, which is typically seen in older adults.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Test for monkeypox virus.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with monkeypox infection. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that is caused by the monkeypox virus. It is characterized by fever, headache, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash that progresses from flat red spots to small blisters and crusting. The patient's history of vesiculobullous lesions on the palms and soles, as well as the presence of erythema, vesicles, and erosions on the face, trunk, and limbs, are all consistent with the rash associated with monkeypox infection.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history as well. Option (A) Carry out pathergy test for Behçet disease is not appropriate because Behçet disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically affects adults, and the patient is a previously healthy 6-year-old boy. Option (B) Obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels may be appropriate if the patient had a history of respiratory symptoms or exposure to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current symptoms. Option (C) Perform an echocardiogram is not necessary at this time, as there is no indication of cardiac involvement.

Order anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level', 'C. Perform flow cytometry', 'D. Perform urine test for porphobilinogen']",A,A,"The correct answer is: Check blood lead concentration

The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest lead poisoning. The bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin, also known as Burton's line, is a classic sign of lead poisoning. The patient's blood tests also show signs consistent with lead poisoning, including elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransaminase levels, as well as elevated total and direct bilirubin levels. The presence of small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear is also indicative of basophilic stippling, which is a common finding in lead poisoning. 

The other options are less likely based on the patient's presentation. ANCA level is used to diagnose vasculitis, but the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest this condition. Flow cytometry is used to diagnose hematologic malignancies, but again, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest this. A urine test for porphobilinogen is used to diagnose porphyria, but the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest this condition either.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to answer, so the answer is False.",A,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to check the blood lead concentration. The patient's presentation with diffuse abdominal pain, along with the bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin and the presence of small bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear, suggests possible lead poisoning.

Lead poisoning can cause abdominal pain, as well as neurological symptoms and anemia. The elevated bilirubin levels may be due to lead-induced hemolysis. Checking the blood lead concentration will help confirm or rule out lead poisoning as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Justification for choosing this answer: Lead poisoning can present with a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain. The presence of bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin and small bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear are suggestive of lead poisoning. Checking the blood lead concentration is a simple and non-invasive test that can help confirm the diagnosis.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",A,Check blood lead concentration,B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would order an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level.

The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, without any obvious cause, suggests a possible diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a condition where the body's immune system attacks the liver, leading to inflammation and damage to the liver cells. The presence of bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin (Figure, panel A) and small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (Figure, panel B) also supports this diagnosis, as these are both signs of chronic liver disease.

ANCA is a type of autoantibody that is commonly elevated in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Therefore, ordering an ANCA level would help to support or rule out this diagnosis. If the ANCA level is elevated, it would suggest a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, and further testing, such as a liver biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Order anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level.

Justify:

The question does not mention any specific medical images that are necessary for the diagnosis. However, the patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain and the presence of bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin suggest that imaging studies may be useful in ruling out other possible causes of liver disease, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer.

After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, her skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, she received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. Her last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation.

The patient's history and clinical presentation are consistent with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by persistent or recurrent infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes with Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans. CMC can present in childhood with oral thrush and onychomycosis, as in this patient. The diagnosis of CMC is clinical and can be confirmed by culture of the Candida species from affected sites. 

The treatment of CMC involves long-term antifungal therapy. Itraconazole is the preferred agent due to its efficacy and safety profile. The patient's history of response to itraconazole supports the decision to restart this medication. 

Oral cefazolin and hydrocortisone cream are not appropriate as they do not have antifungal activity. Oral terbinafine is primarily used for dermatophyte infections and is less effective against Candida species.

The patient's recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, along with the presence of fungal elements on skin scrapings and growth of Candida albicans on fungal culture, suggest a fungal infection. Terbinafine is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida albicans and is commonly used to treat fungal infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes.

Oral cefazolin is an antibiotic and would not be effective in treating a fungal infection. Prescribing hydrocortisone cream would only provide symptomatic relief for the patient's skin symptoms but would not address the underlying fungal infection. Restarting daily oral itraconazole, which the patient has previously been on, may not be effective as the infection has recurred despite previous treatment with itraconazole.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,"Restart daily oral itraconazole

The patient has a history of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities that resolve with oral itraconazole and recur after discontinuing it. The fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans, which supports the diagnosis of recurrent candidiasis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to restart daily oral itraconazole to treat the current symptoms and prevent further recurrences.

The question does not require a medical image to make a decision.",C,"Based on the patient's history of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, and the recent growth of Candida albicans from skin scrapings, I would restart daily oral itraconazole. Itraconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida infections. The patient has had a history of recurrent infections, and the fact that the patient's symptoms have resolved in the past with itraconazole treatment suggests that this medication is effective for her condition.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Restart daily oral itraconazole.

Justification:

The patient's history of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, and the recent growth of Candida albicans from skin scrapings, suggests that she has a fungal infection. Itraconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida infections, and has been shown to be effective in treating oral candidiasis, cutaneous candidiasis, and onychomycosis.

The patient's symptoms of recurrent eye pain and redness, new-onset pain and erythema of the ear, and weight loss are suggestive of a systemic inflammatory condition. The most likely diagnosis in this case is relapsing polychondritis, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and deterioration of cartilage. The areas that are commonly affected are the ears, nose, respiratory tract, eyes, and joints. 

A biopsy of the affected cartilage is the most definitive way to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy would show inflammation and degeneration of the cartilage if the patient has relapsing polychondritis. 

The other options are not as appropriate at this stage. Chest radiography and PFT might be useful if there were symptoms or signs of respiratory involvement, which this patient does not have. Prednisone is a treatment for relapsing polychondritis, but it would be premature to start this without a definitive diagnosis. Ibuprofen could help with symptoms but would not address the underlying condition.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are sufficient to make a decision. So, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a biopsy of the left ear. The patient's presentation is consistent with a condition called relapsing polychondritis, which is characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilaginous structures such as the ears, nose, and tracheobronchial tree. Biopsy of the affected tissue can help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating inflammation and destruction of cartilage.

Performing chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) may be indicated in patients with relapsing polychondritis to assess for involvement of the tracheobronchial tree, but it would not be the initial step in this patient.

Prescribing prednisone, a corticosteroid, is the mainstay of treatment for relapsing polychondritis. However, before initiating treatment, it is important to confirm the diagnosis with a biopsy.

Prescribing ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may provide symptomatic relief for pain and inflammation, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a biopsy of the left ear. The patient's symptoms of pain and erythema in the left eye and left ear, along with a significant weight loss, raise suspicion for a systemic condition such as Wegener's granulomatosis or sarcoidosis. A biopsy of the affected area can help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment. While chest radiography and pulmonary function testing may be useful in evaluating possible lung involvement, they are not the most immediate priority. Similarly, prescribing prednisone or ibuprofen without a confirmed diagnosis may not be appropriate or effective.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to perform a biopsy of the left ear. The patient's symptoms of new-onset pain and erythema of his left eye and left ear, along with the swollen and erythematous cartilaginous portion of his left ear, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process. The fact that the patient experienced similar episodes in the past, which were self-limited, suggests that the current episode may also be self-limited, but it is still important to rule out any serious underlying conditions.

A biopsy of the left ear would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the cause of the patient's symptoms, such as an infection, inflammation, or cancer. This would guide further management and treatment.

Chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) may also be useful in ruling out any pulmonary causes of the patient's symptoms, but they are not the most appropriate next step given the patient's primary symptoms and physical examination findings.

Prescribing prednisone or ibuprofen without a definitive diagnosis may not be appropriate, as these medications may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793518,"A 58-year-old woman with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a low serum HBV DNA value, normal liver enzyme values, and no evidence of cirrhosis presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise. Her last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. She was not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. She reported no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus (Figure). Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Check plasma HIV-1 RNA level', 'B. Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody', 'C. Order testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody', 'D. Order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA']",D,D,"The correct answer is: Order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA.

The patient's history of intravenous drug use and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, along with her recent onset of jaundice and malaise, suggest a possible superinfection with hepatitis D virus (HDV). HDV is a defective RNA virus that requires the presence of HBV for its replication and can cause severe acute hepatitis, particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection. The risk factors for HDV infection include intravenous drug use, high-risk sexual behavior, and travel or residence in an endemic area. The patient's recent intravenous drug use and chronic HBV infection make HDV superinfection a likely possibility.

Testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody, anti–smooth muscle antibody, and plasma HIV-1 RNA level are less likely to be helpful in this case. Hepatitis E virus is typically associated with travel to endemic areas and consumption of contaminated water or food, neither of which is reported by the patient. Anti–smooth muscle antibody is associated with autoimmune hepatitis, which is less likely given the patient's history and presentation. HIV infection could potentially exacerbate liver disease, but the patient's HIV antibody test was negative.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to order testing for hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgM antibody. 

The patient's sudden onset of painless jaundice and malaise, along with the absence of other viral infections such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and HIV, raises suspicion for acute hepatitis E infection. Hepatitis E is a viral infection that can cause acute hepatitis and is typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often associated with contaminated water or food. It is more commonly seen in developing countries but can also occur in developed countries.

Testing for HEV IgM antibody can help confirm the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E infection. IgM antibodies are produced early in the course of infection and their presence indicates recent exposure to the virus. If the HEV IgM antibody test is positive, further testing can be done to determine the HEV RNA level and assess the severity of the infection.

The other options listed (checking plasma HIV-1 RNA level, testing for anti-smooth muscle antibody, and testing for hepatitis delta virus IgM and IgG antibodies) are not indicated based on the given clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Therefore, ordering testing for HEV IgM antibody is the most appropriate next step.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody. 

The patient's history of intravenous drug use and chronic HBV infection puts her at risk for other viral hepatitides, such as hepatitis E. The sudden onset of painless jaundice and normal liver enzyme values also suggest the possibility of hepatitis E infection. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody. 

Checking the plasma HIV-1 RNA level would not be appropriate as the patient's HIV antibody test was negative. Ordering testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody would not be appropriate as there is no evidence of autoimmune hepatitis. Ordering testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA would not be appropriate as the patient's HBV DNA value is low and there is no evidence of HBV reactivation.",,"Based on the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the patient's sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise, and the negative results for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody, it is likely that the patient has acute hepatitis B virus (AHB) infection.

Therefore, the best next step would be to order testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) IgM antibody to confirm the diagnosis of AHB.

Option B, ordering testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody, may also be considered, as hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can cause similar symptoms and laboratory abnormalities as AHB. However, given the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic HBV infection, AHB is a more likely diagnosis.

Option A, checking plasma HIV-1 RNA level, is not necessary at this time, as the patient has no history of HIV infection and the risk of HIV transmission through intravenous drug use is low.

Option D, ordering testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Option E, ordering testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, testing for HDV RNA, may also be considered, as HDV infection can cause similar symptoms and laboratory abnormalities as AHB. However, given the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic HBV infection, AHB is a more likely diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of digital erythema, painful finger ulcers, dyspnea on exertion, and physical findings of livedo racemosa, erythema, retiform purpura, and ulcers overlying her phalangeal joint creases and fingertips, along with the presence of crackles at the lung bases, are suggestive of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disease characterized by skin thickening and internal organ involvement, including the lungs. Anti-scl-70 (anti-topoisomerase I) antibodies are associated with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and anticentromere antibodies are associated with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. 

The other choices are less likely given the patient's presentation. A chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel would be more appropriate if there was suspicion of an inflammatory myopathy, which this patient does not appear to have given the normal strength and range of motion in her hands. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus, which is less likely given the absence of other lupus-specific symptoms. A muscle biopsy would be indicated if there was suspicion of a primary muscle disease, which again, this patient does not appear to have.

The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and crackles on lung auscultation suggest the possibility of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which can be associated with certain autoimmune conditions. The chest CT scan would help evaluate the extent and severity of any lung involvement.

Additionally, the patient's digital erythema, painful finger ulcers, and other skin findings are concerning for an underlying connective tissue disease, such as dermatomyositis. Therefore, ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel would help identify any specific autoantibodies associated with dermatomyositis or other related conditions.

Ordering testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody would be more relevant in the evaluation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which does not seem to be the primary concern in this case.

Similarly, testing for anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies would be more appropriate in the evaluation of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.

Performing a muscle biopsy would be indicated if there were specific clinical findings suggestive of an underlying myopathy, such as muscle weakness or elevated creatine kinase levels. However, in this case, the patient has normal strength throughout all muscle groups and a normal creatine kinase level, making a muscle biopsy less necessary at this point.

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and inflammation in the skin and internal organs. The presence of anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies in the blood can support the diagnosis of SSc.

Therefore, the next step would be to order testing for anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies to help confirm the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis.

The patient's nasal deformity, in the absence of trauma or other clear causes, along with her joint pain, suggests the possibility of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis. This is a form of vasculitis that often affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys, but can also involve the joints. The ANCA test is used to help diagnose this condition, as most patients with GPA will have a positive ANCA.

The other tests listed are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms. Antinuclear antibody and complement levels are used to diagnose autoimmune conditions, but the patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest such a condition. Angiography of the aorta and renal arteries would be more relevant if the patient had symptoms of vascular disease, which she does not. The RPR and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test are used to diagnose syphilis, which also does not fit well with the patient's symptoms.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers. This patient's symptoms, including the nasal deformity, could be indicative of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), also known as Wegener granulomatosis. GPA is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organs, including the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. It commonly presents with upper respiratory symptoms, such as sinusitis and nasal deformities, as well as joint pain. Checking ANCA titers, specifically anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, can help confirm the diagnosis of GPA.

The other options listed are less likely in this case. Checking antinuclear antibody (ANA) and complement levels would be more appropriate if there were signs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases, which are not evident in this patient. Conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries would be indicated if there were signs of renal artery stenosis or other vascular abnormalities, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Ordering rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test would be appropriate if there were signs or symptoms suggestive of syphilis, which are not described in this case.

The patient's presentation of multiple joint pains, normal physical examination findings, and a history of osteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnea treated with nasal CPAP, raises the suspicion of an inflammatory joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. Checking antinuclear antibody (ANA) and complement levels can help in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.

I did not choose the other options because:

1. Checking ANCA titers is more relevant in the evaluation of vasculitis, which is not a primary concern in this case.
2. Performing conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries is unnecessary at this stage, as there is no indication of vascular disease or significant cardiovascular symptoms.
3.

The patient's symptoms of worsening pain in her hands, wrists, and feet, along with the absence of redness, warmth, or swelling of any joints, suggest a possible diagnosis of polyarticular inflammation. The presence of degenerative changes in the radiographs of her hands and wrists performed 1 month prior also support this diagnosis.

ANCA titers are commonly used to diagnose and monitor vasculitic disorders, such as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The patient's nasal deformity, which she attributed to use of her CPAP mask, may also be a sign of a vasculitic disorder.

Therefore, checking ANCA titers would be the most appropriate next step to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of vasculitis.

Answer: Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

His temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F); heart rate, 102/min; blood pressure, 98/72 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 12/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. His skin examination revealed 3 tender, nonfluctuant 10-cm scalp plaques with overlying hemorrhagic crust and necrosis on an erythematous indurated base (Figure, left panel). Similar-appearing papules and plaques were present on the dorsal surfaces of his hands. The remainder of his physical examination was normal.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Obtain blood cultures and start intravenous vancomycin', 'B. Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics', 'C. Perform incision and drainage of the skin lesions', 'D.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and skin lesions, along with his vital signs and physical examination findings, suggest a systemic infection. The skin lesions, described as tender plaques with hemorrhagic crust and necrosis, are suggestive of ecthyma gangrenosum, a cutaneous infection often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients and can be associated with bacteremia. Therefore, obtaining blood cultures and starting empiric antibiotic therapy with a broad-spectrum agent such as vancomycin would be the appropriate next step.

Performing a bone marrow biopsy would be more appropriate if there were signs of a hematologic malignancy, which is not suggested by the information given. Incision and drainage would be more appropriate for an abscess, but the lesions are described as nonfluctuant, making this less likely. Oral dapsone is used for certain dermatologic conditions like dermatitis herpetiformis and leprosy, which do not fit with this patient's presentation.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description provided is quite detailed. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",,"Based on the patient's presentation of fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and enlarging lesions on the scalp and hands, along with the physical examination findings of tender, nonfluctuant scalp plaques with hemorrhagic crust and necrosis, a likely diagnosis to consider is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically mycosis fungoides.

Given the clinical suspicion of CTCL, the next step would be to perform a skin biopsy for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis. This would involve obtaining a sample of the affected skin and sending it for analysis by a pathologist. The histopathological findings, along with immunohistochemistry and molecular studies, can help differentiate CTCL from other skin conditions and determine the specific subtype.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case would be to perform a skin biopsy, rather than any of the other options provided.",B,"Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible hematologic malignancy, such as disseminated histiocytic dermosclerosis, which is more common in patients with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics to help identify the underlying cause of the skin lesions and constitutional symptoms. Starting intravenous vancomycin would be premature without first identifying the causative organism. Incision and drainage of the skin lesions would not provide information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may lead to further complications. Oral dapsone may be considered after a diagnosis is established, but it would not provide a definitive treatment without first identifying the underlying cause.",B,"Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss, along with the skin lesions, suggest a possible diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma, such as mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome. A bone marrow biopsy would help to confirm this diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

The option to obtain blood cultures and start intravenous vancomycin is not appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence of infection or sepsis. Similarly, prescribing oral dapsone would not be appropriate without further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis. Incision and drainage of the skin lesions may be considered later, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Therefore, the answer is:

B. Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics would help to confirm this diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease. This is a standard diagnostic test for patients with suspected cutaneous lymphoma, and it would provide valuable information for guiding further management.

Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), her thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and she was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Add intravenous amphotericin B', 'B. Further surgical debridement', 'C. Start hyperbaric oxygen therapy', 'D. Start intravenous glucocorticoids']",D,B,"The correct choice would be ""Further surgical debridement"". 

The patient's clinical picture is suggestive of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI), a severe bacterial infection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. NSTI typically presents with severe pain out of proportion to physical findings, fever, and systemic toxicity. The hallmark of NSTI is rapid progression of infection with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. 

The mainstay of treatment for NSTI is early and aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue, as this has been shown to decrease mortality. Antibiotics alone are insufficient due to poor penetration into necrotic tissue. Therefore, despite the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further surgical debridement would be the next best step in management.

The other options are not as suitable. Intravenous amphotericin B is an antifungal, which is not indicated here as the cultures were negative for fungal organisms. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an adjunctive treatment and not first-line. Intravenous glucocorticoids are not typically used in the treatment of NSTI.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to further surgical debridement. This is because the patient's symptoms, including persistent thigh pain and swelling, along with the development of septic shock, suggest a deep-seated infection that has not responded to initial treatment. Surgical debridement involves removing infected or necrotic tissue, which can help control the infection and promote healing.

The other options listed, such as adding intravenous amphotericin B, starting hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or starting intravenous glucocorticoids, are not indicated based on the information provided. There is no evidence of fungal infection or tissue ischemia that would warrant the use of amphotericin B or hyperbaric oxygen therapy, respectively. Similarly, there is no indication for the use of intravenous glucocorticoids in this case.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,Further surgical debridement,B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Further surgical debridement.

The patient's symptoms of painful swelling on her right thigh, which did not improve with oral antibiotics and intravenous clindamycin, suggest the presence of a severe infection. The negative wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage suggest that the infection is not caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi. The patient's recent history of methergine injection and the lack of improvement with antibiotics suggest that the infection may be caused by a fungal or viral agent.

Given these findings, further surgical debridement would be the most appropriate next step. Debridement is a surgical procedure that removes dead tissue, which can help to eliminate the source of the infection and promote healing. Intravenous amphotericin B (option 1) is an antifungal medication that may be effective against fungal infections, but it is not appropriate at this stage, as the diagnosis of a fungal infection has not been confirmed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (option 3) may be beneficial in treating certain types of infections, but it is not typically used in the treatment of fungal or viral infections. Intravenous glucocorticoids (option 4) are not indicated in the treatment of infections and may actually worsen the infection by suppressing the immune system.

Justify: True. Medical images, such as X-rays or CT scans, may be necessary to evaluate the extent of the infection and assess the effectiveness of debridement.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the presence of a severe infection that has not responded to antibiotics. Further surgical debridement is necessary to remove any remaining infected tissue and promote healing. The use of intravenous amphotericin B, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and intravenous glucocorticoids may be considered in certain situations, but they are not the most appropriate next steps based on the information provided.",jama

She had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, she developed pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. She did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to her forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, her vital signs were normal. She had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on her upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to her skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Advise the patient against future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination because of allergy', 'B. Prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and refer for allergy testing', 'C.

Prescribe oral prednisone (60 mg per day for 5 days)']",C,C,"The correct course of action would be to ""Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist"". 

The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a condition characterized by the sudden, spontaneous appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks. CSU is not a contraindication for COVID-19 vaccination, and the patient's symptoms did not occur immediately after vaccination, which would be more indicative of an allergic reaction. 

The first-line treatment for CSU is a nonsedating (second-generation) H1 antihistamine. If symptoms persist, the dose can be increased up to 4 times the standard dose. Other treatments, such as omalizumab, cyclosporine, or corticosteroids, can be considered if high-dose antihistamines are ineffective, but these are not first-line treatments.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to a high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist. This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with an allergic reaction, specifically urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling). The fact that the lesions fade without scarring within 24 hours suggests an acute allergic response. The wheal and flare lesions elicited by pressure on the forearm and skin with a tongue depressor further support the diagnosis of an allergic reaction. 

Prescribing a nonsedating antihistamine, such as cetirizine or loratadine, is the first-line treatment for allergic reactions. If symptoms persist despite standard-dose antihistamine therapy, increasing the dose to a high-dose antihistamine, such as cetirizine 20 mg or loratadine 20 mg, can be considered. This approach aims to control the symptoms and prevent further allergic reactions.

Allergy testing and prescribing a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector are not indicated at this point. Allergy testing may be considered in the future if the patient experiences recurrent or severe allergic reactions. Prescribing oral prednisone is not necessary in this case as the symptoms are not severe and can be managed with antihistamines.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,"The correct answer is: Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist. 

Explanation: The patient developed a rash and eyelid swelling after receiving a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. However, she did not experience any life-threatening symptoms such as lip, tongue, or neck swelling, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, or palpitations. Therefore, prescribing a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increasing to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist is the appropriate treatment. There is no need to advise the patient against future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination because of allergy, prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector, or prescribe oral prednisone. The patient should be referred for allergy testing to determine the cause of the allergic reaction.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and refer for allergy testing.

The patient's symptoms of pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling, as well as the development of wheal and flare lesions on her neck, chest, trunk, and arms, suggest a possible allergic reaction to the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. The fact that these symptoms resolved within 24 hours and did not result in any serious complications suggests that the reaction was likely mild to moderate.

Given the patient's history of mild to moderate allergic reactions to the vaccine, it would be appropriate to prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector in case of a severe allergic reaction in the future. Additionally, referring the patient for allergy testing would help to determine the specific allergen that triggered the reaction and guide future management decisions.

Option 1, advising the patient against future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination because of allergy, may be considered, but it would be premature to make this decision without further evaluation and testing. Option 3, prescribing a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increasing to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist, may be appropriate for mild to moderate allergic reactions, but it would not address the underlying allergy or provide adequate protection in case of a severe allergic reaction. Option 4, prescribing oral prednisone (60 mg per day for 5 days), may be considered for severe allergic reactions, but it would not be the first-line treatment for a mild to moderate allergic reaction.

Begin intravenous acyclovir', 'B. Perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry', 'C. Begin intravenous ganciclovir', 'D. Begin azathioprine and infliximab']",C,A,"The correct answer is: Begin intravenous acyclovir.

The patient's presentation of oral thrush, severe immunosuppression (CD4 count <200/mm3), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is suggestive of AIDS-related lymphoma, which is a common AIDS-defining cancer. The patient's lymphoma is being appropriately treated with R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) and antiretroviral therapy. However, given the patient's profound immunosuppression, he is at risk for opportunistic infections, including herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus, which can cause severe disease in this population. Prophylaxis with acyclovir is recommended in patients with CD4 counts <50/mm3 to prevent these infections.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry would be indicated if there was a suspicion of intraocular lymphoma, which this patient does not have. Intravenous ganciclovir would be used for cytomegalovirus infection, which this patient does not have. Azathioprine and infliximab are used for autoimmune diseases, not for this patient's condition.

- Beginning azathioprine and infliximab are immunosuppressive medications used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, which are not indicated in this patient.
 
Justification for the chosen answer: The patient's presentation, including the positive HIV test, low CD4 count, and biopsy-proven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, suggests an HIV-related lymphoma. Vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",A,"Based on the information provided, the patient has been diagnosed with HIV and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient has started antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy. The question asks what would be the next step in the management of the patient. 

The correct answer is to begin intravenous acyclovir. This is because the patient has oral thrush, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. Intravenous acyclovir is the standard treatment for severe oral thrush in patients with HIV. 

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Performing vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry is not indicated as there is no mention of ocular symptoms or findings. Beginning intravenous ganciclovir is not indicated as the patient does not have a viral load of HSV or CMV. Beginning azathioprine and infliximab is not indicated as the patient does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms or findings. 

In summary, based on the information provided, the correct answer is to begin intravenous acyclovir.",A,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to begin intravenous acyclovir.

The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness, suggest that the patient may have a viral infection. The positive HIV Ab/Ag combination assay and high HIV viral load support this diagnosis. The patient's low CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 also indicates that they are severely immunocompromised, which increases their risk of developing opportunistic infections.

The computed tomography (CT) scan findings of thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon, as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe, suggest that the patient may have a fungal infection, such as candidiasis. The presence of oral thrush also supports this diagnosis.

Intravenous acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. It is not effective against fungal infections, so it would not be appropriate to use it to treat the patient's fungal infection.

Intravenous ganciclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), but it is not effective against fungal infections.

Beginning azathioprine and infliximab would not be appropriate at this time, as they are immunosuppressive medications that are used to treat autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's low CD4 cell count and high HIV viral load indicate that they are severely immunocompromised, and using immunosuppressive medications could further weaken their immune system and increase their risk of infections.

Performing vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a vitreoretinal infection.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to begin intravenous acyclovir to treat the patient's suspected viral infection.

The patient's symptoms of pharyngitis, tonsillar exudates, and neck swelling, along with the lack of response to antibiotics, suggest a possible abscess or other structural abnormality that may not be responsive to antibiotic treatment. An ultrasound of the neck can help identify any abscesses, tumors, or other structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. 

The other options are less likely to be helpful in this case. Prescribing azithromycin would not be beneficial as the patient has already been on amoxicillin without improvement, and the throat culture was negative, suggesting that the infection is not bacterial. Rechecking a rapid heterophile antibody test would not be beneficial as the initial test was negative and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Treating with an oral antifungal medication would not be the first line of action without evidence of a fungal infection.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test. The patient's symptoms of pharyngitis, tonsillar exudates, and neck swelling, along with the negative results of the rapid strep test and throat culture, raise suspicion for infectious mononucleosis (caused by Epstein-Barr virus). The rapid heterophile antibody test is commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis, and rechecking it would help confirm or rule out this diagnosis.

Prescribing azithromycin or treating with an oral antifungal medication would not be appropriate in this case, as there is no indication for a bacterial or fungal infection based on the clinical presentation and negative test results.

Obtaining an ultrasound of the neck is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest any specific neck pathology that would require imaging.

Justification for not needing a medical image: False.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test. This is because the patient has presented with symptoms of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral infections, including streptococcal infection and infectious mononucleosis. The negative results of the rapid strep test and throat culture do not rule out the possibility of infectious mononucleosis, which can be confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody test. Therefore, rechecking the rapid heterophile antibody test would be the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to Prescribe azithromycin.

The patient's symptoms of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates, along with the negative rapid strep test and throat culture results, suggest that the patient likely has a viral infection. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes, which can cause pharyngitis.

It is unlikely that an ultrasound of the neck would be necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest any specific indication for imaging.

Rechecking a rapid heterophile antibody test may be unnecessary, as the patient has already had a negative test result and the likelihood of a false negative result is low.

Treating the patient with an oral antifungal medication would not be appropriate, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a fungal infection.

Perform an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time lumpectomy is performed', 'D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes']",D,D,"The correct answer is: Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

The reason for this choice is that the patient has been diagnosed with high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts and has not spread into any other part of the breast. Given the patient's diagnosis and the presence of a palpable mass, it is important to evaluate the axillary lymph nodes to determine if the cancer has spread. An axillary ultrasound can help identify any enlarged lymph nodes, which can then be biopsied to confirm if they contain cancer cells.

The other options are not as immediately relevant. A repeat breast MRI or axillary ultrasound after vaccination would not provide immediate information about the status of the lymph nodes. Performing an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy is also an option, but it would be more beneficial to have this information before surgery to help guide treatment decisions.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly.

The patient has been diagnosed with high-grade, estrogen receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which indicates the presence of breast cancer. The physical examination reveals a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o'clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. This suggests the possibility of lymph node involvement.

Performing a right axillary ultrasound now, with the intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes, would help determine if there is any spread of cancer to the axillary lymph nodes. This information is crucial for staging the cancer and determining the appropriate treatment plan.

Justification for the chosen answer:
Performing a repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination is not necessary in this case, as the patient's condition is unrelated to vaccination.

Performing right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination is also not necessary, as the patient's condition is not related to vaccination.

Performing an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time lumpectomy is performed may be considered, but it is important to evaluate the lymph nodes before surgery to determine the extent of lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform right axillary ultrasound now, with the intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

Justification for the need for medical image:
Based on the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned whether a medical image is required to answer the question.

Therefore, the answer is True.",D,"Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

The patient has been diagnosed with high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) based on the results of the ultrasound-guided biopsy. The next step is to assess the involvement of axillary lymph nodes, which can be done using ultrasound. If enlarged lymph nodes are detected, they should be biopsied to determine the extent of cancer spread.",',"As a professional doctor, I would choose option 4: Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

The patient has been diagnosed with high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and the next step would be to assess the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis. Enlarged lymph nodes on ultrasound would indicate a higher likelihood of metastasis, and biopsy would be necessary to confirm this.

Performing a right axillary ultrasound now would allow for timely assessment of the lymph nodes and enable appropriate planning for further treatment. If the ultrasound reveals enlarged lymph nodes, a biopsy could be performed during the same procedure, providing valuable information for staging and guiding treatment decisions.

Option 1, repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination, may not provide the necessary information about the axillary lymph nodes and would likely not be the next step in management.

Option 2, perform right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination, may also not provide the necessary information about the axillary lymph nodes at the present time, and may delay appropriate treatment.

Option 3, perform an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time lumpectomy is performed, may be a consideration, but it would be more appropriate to perform the biopsy after the ultrasound has confirmed the presence of enlarged lymph nodes.

Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, her fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema.

Schedule parathyroidectomy', 'D. Stop voriconazole']",D,D,"The correct action to take next would be to ""Stop voriconazole"". 

The patient's symptoms of polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, without other systemic symptoms, are suggestive of drug-induced arthritis. Voriconazole, an antifungal medication, is known to cause periostitis and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, which can present with similar symptoms. The patient's symptoms started after the initiation of voriconazole therapy, which further supports this diagnosis. 

Stopping the medication is the first step in managing drug-induced arthritis. The patient should be monitored closely for improvement in symptoms after discontinuation of the drug. If symptoms persist, further investigation may be necessary.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a bone biopsy. The patient's symptoms of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, along with her medical history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease, raise concerns for a possible underlying bone pathology. A bone biopsy would help to determine the cause of her symptoms and guide further management.

Obtaining a positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan may be useful in certain situations, such as evaluating for metastatic disease or assessing response to treatment. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a more localized bone pathology, making a bone biopsy a more appropriate initial step.

Scheduling parathyroidectomy may be considered in patients with hyperparathyroidism, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, and her tertiary hyperparathyroidism is likely secondary to her chronic kidney disease.

Stopping voriconazole may be considered if there is concern for drug-induced arthropathy. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with drug-induced arthropathy, and voriconazole is an important medication for her invasive fungal infection.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",B,"Perform a bone biopsy

The patient is presenting with symptoms of polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, which could be indicative of a musculoskeletal disorder. The medical history includes tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, a bone biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to help diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further treatment decisions.",B,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a bone biopsy.

The patient's symptoms of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, along with the absence of other symptoms such as alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon, suggest a possible diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). CPPD is a condition in which calcium pyrophosphate crystals accumulate in various joints and tissues, leading to inflammation and pain.

The patient's history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease and invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system complicating her kidney transplant also increase the likelihood of CPPD.

A bone biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of CPPD, as it can identify the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the bone tissue.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Perform a bone biopsy.

Justification for not choosing other options:

(A) Obtain a positron emission computed tomography scan: While a PET scan may be useful in some cases of CPPD to assess the extent of disease, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case, as it may not provide definitive diagnostic information and may not be able to differentiate between CPPD and other conditions.

(C) Schedule parathyroidectomy: Parathyroidectomy may be necessary in some cases of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case, as the focus should be on diagnosing and managing the underlying CPPD.

(D) Stop voriconazole: While voriconazole may be associated with an increased risk of CPPD, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case, as the drug is being used to treat the patient's invasive fungal infection and stopping it may compromise her treatment.

The patient's symptoms of arthralgias, purpuric rash, paresthesias, and bilateral eye pain and redness, along with the lack of improvement with prednisone, suggest a systemic vasculitis. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a type of systemic vasculitis that can present with these symptoms. ANCA titers are often elevated in this condition, so checking ANCA titers would be a reasonable next step in this patient's evaluation.

Chikungunya serology would be considered if the patient had a history of travel to an area where Chikungunya is endemic, which is not mentioned in the case. A transthoracic echocardiogram would be more appropriate if the patient had symptoms suggestive of cardiac involvement, which is also not the case here. A urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis would be considered if the patient had symptoms suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection, which is not mentioned in the case.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms of arthralgias, purpuric rash, foot paresthesias, and eye pain and redness, along with the lack of fevers, respiratory symptoms, or hematuria, the most appropriate next step would be to check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. The symptoms described by the patient, such as joint pain, rash, and eye involvement, are consistent with AAV. Checking ANCA titers can help confirm the diagnosis, as the majority of patients with AAV have positive ANCA antibodies.

Chikungunya serology is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with chikungunya infection. Chikungunya typically presents with fever, joint pain, and rash, but does not typically involve eye pain or purpuric rash.

A transthoracic echocardiogram is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest cardiac involvement. There is no mention of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or signs of heart failure.

Ordering a urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a genitourinary infection. There is no mention of urinary symptoms or risk factors for Chlamydia trachomatis infection.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",A,"Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers

The patient's symptoms, including arthralgias, purpuric rash, and paresthesias, suggest the possibility of vasculitis, an autoimmune condition that could be caused by ANCA-associated vasculitis.

The other options are less relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history.",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

The patient's symptoms of arthralgias, purpuric rash, foot paresthesias, and bilateral eye pain and redness suggest a possible diagnosis of vasculitis, an inflammatory condition that affects blood vessels. ANCA titers are commonly used to help diagnose and monitor vasculitis, as they can detect the presence of antibodies directed against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens, which are often elevated in patients with vasculitis.

Chikungunya serology and a transthoracic echocardiogram may also be considered in the patient's evaluation, but they are not as directly related to the patient's symptoms and medical history as ANCA titers. A urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis is not typically used to diagnose vasculitis.

Therefore, the answer is:

* Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers

Justification:

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a possible diagnosis of vasculitis, which is a condition that ANCA titers can help diagnose and monitor. The patient's history of diet-controlled diabetes and recent use of prednisone without improvement also support this decision.

Medical image:

It would be appropriate to order a medical image, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, to evaluate the patient's symptoms of bilateral eye pain and redness, as well as to rule out other potential causes of her symptoms. Therefore, the answer is:

He had recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia due to infection of an ICD lead and had been treated for the past 6 months with minocycline, 100 mg twice daily. His arms had been purple and bruise-like for several years but turned a near black color 1 month ago. He reported no discoloration of his sweat or urine. He had no history of malnutrition and reported infrequent alcohol use.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Discontinue apixaban', 'B. Discontinue minocycline', 'C. Order serum iron studies', 'D. Order serum niacin levels']",B,B,"The correct answer is: Discontinue minocycline

The patient's skin discoloration is likely due to minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation, a known side effect of long-term minocycline use. This condition is characterized by blue-gray to black discoloration of the skin and can occur anywhere on the body. It is usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, although it may take several months to years for the pigmentation to completely resolve. 

The other options are less likely. Apixaban is an anticoagulant used to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and there is no indication to discontinue it based on the information provided. Serum iron studies and serum niacin levels are not relevant to the patient's presentation.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. So, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's presentation of progressive skin discoloration, it is important to consider potential causes related to his medical history and medications. In this case, the most likely cause of the skin discoloration is minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation. Minocycline is known to cause a blue-black pigmentation of the skin, especially in areas exposed to sunlight. Discontinuing minocycline would be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's skin discoloration.

Therefore, the correct answer is to discontinue minocycline.

The patient's medical history of chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, cirrhosis, and ischemic cardiomyopathy are not directly related to the skin discoloration. Ordering serum iron studies or serum niacin levels would not be indicated in this case.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,"Based on the patient's medical history and presenting symptoms, the most appropriate next step would be to order serum iron studies. The patient's chronic kidney disease and cirrhosis put him at risk for iron overload, which can cause skin discoloration. Additionally, the minocycline he has been taking for his recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia can also cause skin discoloration, but it is unlikely to cause the near-black color the patient is experiencing. Discontinuing apixaban or minocycline without further investigation could be harmful to the patient's health. Therefore, ordering serum iron studies is the most appropriate next step.",C,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 3: Order serum iron studies.

The patient's progressive skin discoloration, particularly the change from purple to near black color, suggests a possible iron deficiency. Iron deficiency can cause skin discoloration, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease and chronic hepatitis C infection, which the patient has. The patient's history of recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia and treatment with minocycline may also contribute to iron deficiency.

Therefore, it is appropriate to order serum iron studies to evaluate the patient's iron status and determine if iron deficiency is contributing to his skin discoloration. This information will help guide further management and potential treatment of the patient's condition.

Justification for medical image: False. While medical images, such as a skin biopsy, may be useful in evaluating the patient's skin discoloration, they are not necessary to make the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

The patient's symptoms of chronic back pain, cough, and fevers, along with his history of immigration from a country with a high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB), suggest a possible diagnosis of TB. Although the patient had a negative interferon gamma release assay 4 years ago, it does not rule out the possibility of a recent infection. 

The combination of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin is a standard regimen for the treatment of TB. Airborne isolation is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease, as TB is transmitted through airborne droplets.

The other options are not as relevant given the patient's symptoms and history. Prostate-specific antigen level is used to screen for prostate cancer, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Cefepime and vancomycin are broad-spectrum antibiotics used for severe bacterial infections, but they are not first-line treatment for TB. Doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin are used for treating brucellosis, a bacterial infection that can be contracted from unpasteurized dairy products or contact with infected animals, but the patient has not reported any such exposure.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to start doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin. 

The patient's symptoms of upper back pain, dry cough, and subjective fevers, along with the history of immigration from India, raise suspicion for tuberculosis (TB). The fact that the symptoms did not improve with empirical azithromycin further supports this suspicion. Therefore, initiating a combination therapy of doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin, which are commonly used to treat TB, would be the most appropriate course of action.

Placing the patient in airborne isolation and starting a four-drug regimen of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms are not severe and there is no indication of multi-drug resistant TB.

Measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is not relevant in this case, as the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest any prostate-related issues.

Starting cefepime and vancomycin is not indicated, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection that would require broad-spectrum antibiotics.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",A,"Based on the given information, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of tuberculosis. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to start the patient on a combination of antibiotics, specifically isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This combination of drugs is commonly used to treat tuberculosis. 

It is not necessary to measure the patient's prostate-specific antigen level as this is a test used to screen for prostate cancer and is not related to the patient's current symptoms. 

Starting cefepime and vancomycin would not be the appropriate next step as these antibiotics are not commonly used to treat tuberculosis. 

While doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin are antibiotics that can be used to treat tuberculosis, it is not the preferred combination of drugs and may not be as effective as the standard four-drug regimen. Therefore, it would not be the appropriate next step. 

In summary, the appropriate next step would be to start the patient on a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol to treat the suspected tuberculosis.",D,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to start doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin.

The patient's symptoms of upper back pain, dry cough, and subjective fevers, along with their history of travel to India and negative results for interferon gamma release assay, suggest the possibility of tuberculosis. The patient's occupation as a software engineer and lack of smoking history, recent animal contact, or unpasteurized animal product ingestion make it less likely that their symptoms are caused by other conditions such as pneumonia or bronchitis.

Doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin are commonly used antibiotics for treating tuberculosis. It is important to note that the patient should also be tested for drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV coinfection.

Therefore, the answer is:

* Start doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin.

Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6).

Administer intravenous antibiotics', 'B. Administer systemic corticosteroids', 'C. Administer anticoagulant therapy', 'D. Check antiphospholipid antibody levels']",D,A,"The correct answer is: Administer intravenous antibiotics.

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of infective endocarditis, a serious infection of the inner layer of the heart, typically affecting the heart valves. The presence of aortic valve vegetations on echocardiogram, along with the patient's symptoms of blurry vision (possibly due to septic emboli), elevated blood pressure, and a holosystolic ejection murmur, are all indicative of this condition. The first line of treatment for infective endocarditis is intravenous antibiotics, which are used to clear the infection.

The other options are less appropriate given the patient's presentation. Systemic corticosteroids are typically used for inflammatory conditions, not infections. Anticoagulant therapy could potentially be dangerous in this case, as it could cause the vegetations to break off and lead to emboli. Checking antiphospholipid antibody levels could be useful in a patient with suspected antiphospholipid syndrome, but this patient's symptoms and test results are more consistent with infective endocarditis.

The medical image is not necessary to answer this question, as the description of the patient's symptoms and test results is sufficient to make a diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to administer intravenous antibiotics. The patient's presentation is consistent with infective endocarditis, as evidenced by the holosystolic ejection murmur and the presence of pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations on echocardiogram. The cotton-wool spots and peripheral arterial occlusion seen on ophthalmologic evaluation may be embolic phenomena resulting from the infected vegetations. Therefore, prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics is crucial to treat the underlying infection and prevent further embolic complications.

The other options listed are not the most appropriate next step in this case:

- Administering systemic corticosteroids would not be the first-line treatment in this scenario, as there is no evidence of an autoimmune or inflammatory condition that would warrant their use.

- Administering anticoagulant therapy may be considered in certain cases of retinal artery occlusion, but in this patient, the primary concern is the underlying infective endocarditis. Anticoagulation alone would not address the source of the emboli.

- Checking antiphospholipid antibody levels may be relevant in certain cases of retinal artery occlusion, as antiphospholipid syndrome can be associated with this condition. However, the patient's clinical presentation, including the presence of infective endocarditis, suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one.

Regarding the need for a medical image, it is not necessary to answer the question correctly.",C,"The correct answer is: Administer anticoagulant therapy

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings, the patient is likely suffering from a hypercoagulable state, as evidenced by the retinal ischemia, intraretinal hemorrhage, and peripheral arterial occlusion. The presence of aortic valve vegetations also suggests a possible infective endocarditis. Administering anticoagulant therapy would help to prevent further thromboembolic events and reduce the risk of complications.

Justification for the question: The question requires an understanding of the clinical presentation and the appropriate management strategy for a patient with suspected hypercoagulable state and infective endocarditis. The corresponding medical image and laboratory results provided in the question help to support the diagnosis and guide the decision-making process.",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most appropriate next step would be to administer anticoagulant therapy. The patient's history of migraine headaches, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, along with the physical examination findings of a holosystolic ejection murmur and the laboratory results of a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive antinuclear antibodies, suggest a high likelihood of an autoimmune disorder. The presence of a cotton-wool spot and intraretinal hemorrhage on the right fundus, along with a peripheral arterial occlusion, suggests a possible diagnosis of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further vision loss.

Administering anticoagulant therapy would help to prevent further thrombotic events and potentially restore blood flow to the affected retinal tissue. The choice of anticoagulant therapy would depend on the patient's medical history and other factors, but options could include heparin, warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

Administering intravenous antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. The patient's history of migraine headaches and hypertension, along with the physical examination findings of a holosystolic ejection murmur, suggest a cardiovascular rather than an infectious etiology.

Administering systemic corticosteroids may be considered in the future if the patient's condition warrants it, but it would not be the most appropriate next step at this time.

Checking antiphospholipid antibody levels may be appropriate in the future if the patient's condition suggests a possible diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, but it would not be the most appropriate next step at this time.

The patient's symptoms of low-grade fevers, myalgias, proximal muscle weakness, dark urine, and difficulty walking, especially after starting nivolumab treatment, suggest a possible immune-related adverse event (irAE). Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, can cause irAEs, including myocarditis, which can be life-threatening. The absence of palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath does not rule out myocarditis. 

The measurement of troponin and natriuretic peptides, as well as an echocardiogram, are necessary to evaluate for possible myocarditis. If these tests are abnormal, further evaluation with cardiac MRI or endomyocardial biopsy may be needed. 

The other options are less appropriate. Intravenous immune globulin and intravenous fluids may be part of the management once the diagnosis is confirmed, but they are not the next best step. A muscle biopsy could be considered if there is a high suspicion of myositis, but the patient's symptoms are not specific for this condition.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to measure troponin and natriuretic peptides, and perform an echocardiogram. 

The patient's symptoms of low-grade fevers, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking, along with a history of melanoma and recent nivolumab treatment, raise concerns for immune-related adverse effects of the immunotherapy. Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, is a known immune-related adverse effect of nivolumab. The symptoms of proximal muscle weakness and difficulty walking could be indicative of myocarditis.

Measuring troponin and natriuretic peptides can help assess for cardiac involvement. Elevated troponin levels would suggest myocardial injury, while elevated natriuretic peptides (such as B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) can indicate cardiac stress or dysfunction.

Performing an echocardiogram can provide further evaluation of the heart's structure and function. It can help identify any abnormalities, such as decreased ejection fraction or signs of myocarditis, which would guide further management.

Therefore, measuring troponin and natriuretic peptides, and performing an echocardiogram would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient's symptoms and potential cardiac involvement.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to measure troponin and natriuretic peptides, and perform an echocardiogram. This is because the patient's symptoms of fever, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness could be indicative of a potential cardiac issue, such as myocarditis or pericarditis, which are known side effects of nivolumab treatment. The echocardiogram would help to evaluate the structure and function of the heart, while the measurement of troponin and natriuretic peptides would help to assess for any potential cardiac damage or dysfunction.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to measure troponin and natriuretic peptides, and perform an echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms of fever, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking, along with their history of melanoma and recent digital amputation, suggest the possibility of a systemic inflammatory response or cardiotoxicity related to the nivolumab treatment. Troponin and natriuretic peptides are markers of cardiac damage and can help determine if there is any cardiac involvement in the patient's symptoms. An echocardiogram can further evaluate the heart's function and structure, helping to identify any potential cardiac issues.

Starting intravenous immune globulin or fluids may be appropriate later, but it is important to first assess the patient's cardiac status and rule out any potential cardiac causes of their symptoms. Obtaining a muscle biopsy may also be necessary, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Measure troponin and natriuretic peptides, and perform an echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness, dry cough, and hair loss, along with his history of opioid and alcohol use disorders, injection drug use, and untreated HIV infection, suggest the possibility of a secondary infection. The RPR test is used to screen for syphilis, which is a common co-infection in patients with HIV, especially those who are immunocompromised and have a history of risky behaviors such as injection drug use. Syphilis can cause a variety of symptoms, including generalized weakness and hair loss, as seen in this patient.

The patient's symptoms and history raise concern for a possible systemic infection, such as syphilis, which can cause a wide range of symptoms including weakness, cough, and hair loss. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis and can help confirm or rule out this diagnosis. 

Checking the antinuclear antibody (ANA) level would be less likely to provide useful information in this case, as the patient's symptoms and history are not suggestive of an autoimmune disorder. Obtaining skin scrapings of the scalp or performing a punch biopsy of the scalp would not be the most appropriate next steps, as the patient's hair loss is likely secondary to a systemic cause rather than a primary scalp disorder.

The patient's history of injection drug use and chronic HIV infection puts him at risk for syphilis, which can cause hair loss. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis that can help determine if further testing and treatment are necessary. 

I did not choose to check the antinuclear antibody level because it is not a specific test for syphilis and is more commonly used to diagnose autoimmune disorders.

The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness, dry cough, and hair loss, combined with a history of injection drug use and chronic HIV infection, suggest a possible diagnosis of syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum, and it can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin rashes, fever, and respiratory symptoms. The patient's history of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy 2 years prior to presentation also increases the likelihood of a syphilis diagnosis.

An RPR test is a rapid blood test that can detect the presence of antibodies against Treponema pallidum in the blood. It is a useful test in the diagnosis of syphilis, particularly in cases where the patient has a high likelihood of having the infection. A positive RPR test result would support the diagnosis of syphilis, while a negative result would make it less likely.

Therefore, Check rapid plasma reagin (RPR) level is the best option.

Justify:

The question does not explicitly state that the patient has a skin rash, which would make it more appropriate to perform a skin scraping or punch biopsy. Additionally, the patient's history of injection drug use and chronic HIV infection increase the likelihood of a syphilis diagnosis, making an RPR test a reasonable next step.

True. A medical image, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, may be necessary to evaluate the patient's respiratory symptoms and to look for any signs of lung disease or other complications related to syphilis.

The patient's diarrhea, dermatitis (rash), and dementia (evidenced by her deconditioning and poor appetite) are suggestive of pellagra, a condition caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. Pellagra is classically characterized by the ""4 Ds"": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death if left untreated. This patient's diet of mostly vegetables is likely low in niacin, and her recent weight loss could have exacerbated this deficiency. Therefore, measuring the serum niacin level would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation. Fecal calprotectin is a marker of intestinal inflammation and is typically elevated in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, which this patient does not appear to have. Fecal ova and parasites could cause diarrhea, but would not explain the rash or dementia. Antitissue transglutaminase antibodies are associated with celiac disease, which can cause diarrhea and rash, but is less likely in this case given the patient's age and lack of other typical symptoms such as bloating or abdominal pain.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's symptoms and history. So, the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the patient's presentation of chronic diarrhea and rash, along with her history of colon adenocarcinoma, it would be prudent to test for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody. This test is used to screen for celiac disease, which can present with chronic diarrhea and dermatitis herpetiformis (a pruritic rash). Celiac disease is more common in patients with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and it is important to rule it out in this patient.

Measuring fecal calprotectin level is a useful test to differentiate between inflammatory bowel disease and non-inflammatory causes of chronic diarrhea. However, given the patient's history and presentation, celiac disease is a more likely diagnosis and should be investigated first.

Checking for fecal ova and parasites is important in cases of acute diarrhea or when there is suspicion of an infectious etiology. However, in this case, the chronic nature of the diarrhea and the presence of a rash make an infectious cause less likely.

Measuring serum niacin level is not indicated in this case. Niacin deficiency can cause a condition called pellagra, which can present with diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. However, this patient's symptoms are more consistent with celiac disease, and pellagra is a rare condition in developed countries.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I would recommend testing for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody.

The patient's history of living in Uganda and swimming in the Nile River, along with his symptoms of recurrent diarrhea and hematochezia, suggest a parasitic infection. The eosinophilia further supports this diagnosis. The most common parasitic infection associated with freshwater exposure in Africa is Schistosomiasis, which is caused by a fluke worm. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treating Schistosomiasis.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's history and symptoms. Additional stool samples for ova and parasite detection could be useful, but the patient's history and symptoms strongly suggest Schistosomiasis, making further testing unnecessary.

Given this clinical suspicion, the next step would be to send 2 additional stool samples for ova and parasite detection. This is because the initial stool microscopy may have missed the presence of Schistosoma eggs, which are diagnostic for schistosomiasis. Multiple stool samples increase the chances of detecting the parasite.

Prescribing praziquantel without further diagnostic testing is not recommended as it is important to confirm the diagnosis before initiating treatment.

Testing for tuberculosis with an interferon-γ release assay is not indicated in this case as there are no clinical features suggestive of tuberculosis, such as cough, night sweats, or weight loss.

Starting antibiotics for tuberculosis (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) is also not indicated as there is no evidence to suggest tuberculosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy, as well as the recent onset of hypopigmented and hyperpigmented patches of skin, also support this possibility. Additionally, the patient's growth faltering and lack of fever suggest a chronic rather than acute illness.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the patient's urine output and protein levels to determine if there is proteinuria, which is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis and urine microscopy can help identify proteinuria and also provide information about the presence of other abnormalities such as blood, casts, or crystals in the urine.

The presence of erythema, purpura, and petechiae over the dorsum of the foot and lower leg could be indicative of venous stasis dermatitis, a condition commonly associated with venous insufficiency. The duplex ultrasound would help to evaluate the blood flow in the lower extremities and identify any potential venous insufficiency. It is important to rule out any underlying vascular conditions before considering other diagnostic tests or treatments. Therefore, a lower extremity duplex ultrasound would be the most appropriate next step.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Order antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels.

The patient's symptoms of episodic fever, diaphoresis, and headaches, along with the presence of a rash and purpura on the right foot and lower leg, suggest a possible autoimmune disorder. The fact that the erythema fades when the leg is elevated above the level of the heart suggests that it may be related to a vasculitic process.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are commonly used markers to diagnose and monitor autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis. Complement levels can also be useful in diagnosing and monitoring these disorders, as they are often low in patients with active disease.

Therefore, I would recommend ordering these tests to help determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to guide further management.

In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 121/82 mm Hg; pulse, 74/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform a skin biopsy', 'B. Administer tissue plasminogen activator', 'C. Start empirical intravenous antibiotics', 'D. Pursue surgical evaluation']",D,C,"The correct choice would be to ""Start empirical intravenous antibiotics"". 

The patient's symptoms and signs, including dizziness, imbalance, bilateral lower extremity weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, a painful rash on the left foot, tenderness of the fingers and toes, petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot, splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail, petechial macules on the palms and soles, left eye nystagmus, inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, acute infarcts in the right cerebellum, mild leukocytosis, mild thrombocytosis, elevated troponin level, and T-wave inversions in lead V2, are suggestive of infective endocarditis. This is a serious condition that can lead to septic emboli, which may explain the neurological symptoms and signs, as well as the myocardial infarction. Empirical intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately while further investigations are carried out to identify the causative organism.

The corresponding medical image is not necessary to answer this question, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The patient's presentation is consistent with multiple embolic events, including acute infarcts in the right cerebellum and a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. These findings suggest the presence of an underlying thrombotic disorder. tPA is a thrombolytic agent that can help dissolve blood clots and restore blood flow in cases of acute ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Given the patient's symptoms and findings, prompt administration of tPA is crucial to minimize further damage and improve outcomes.

A skin biopsy would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more indicative of an underlying thrombotic disorder rather than a primary dermatological condition. Therefore, a skin biopsy would not provide relevant information for the current clinical presentation.

Starting empirical intravenous antibiotics would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not suggestive of an infectious process. There is no evidence of systemic infection, such as fever or leukocytosis, and the patient's rash is likely secondary to the underlying thrombotic disorder rather than an infectious cause.

Pursuing surgical evaluation would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a thrombotic disorder rather than a surgical emergency. Surgical intervention is not indicated based on the information provided.

Justification for the answer: The patient's presentation with acute infarcts in the cerebellum, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and other thrombotic manifestations suggests an underlying thrombotic disorder. Prompt administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can help dissolve blood clots and restore blood flow, minimizing further damage and improving outcomes.

The question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,"Administer tissue plasminogen activator. 

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate a possible case of embolic stroke caused by cardiac vegetations. The administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is a recommended treatment for ischemic stroke caused by embolism. A skin biopsy would not be helpful in this case, as it would not provide information about the patient's cardiac condition. Starting empirical intravenous antibiotics would not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. Pursuing surgical evaluation would not be the first step in this case, as the patient's condition can be managed medically with TPA.",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to pursue surgical evaluation. The patient's symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and blurred vision, along with the physical examination findings of petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, and petechial macules, suggest a possible diagnosis of a vasculitis or a bleeding disorder. The presence of a painful rash on the left foot with tenderness of the fingers and toes also suggests a possible infectious or inflammatory process.

The CT scan of the head showing 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum suggests that the patient may have a underlying cardiovascular disease, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The elevated troponin level and T-wave inversions in lead V2 on the electrocardiogram also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, it would be appropriate to pursue surgical evaluation to further assess the patient's cardiovascular status and to rule out any surgical emergencies. This may include a cardiac catheterization or other imaging studies to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries and to determine the extent of any cardiovascular disease.

Performing a skin biopsy or administering tissue plasminogen activator may also be appropriate next steps, but they would depend on the results of the surgical evaluation and the patient's clinical status. Empirical intravenous antibiotics may be appropriate if there is a concern for an infectious cause of the patient's symptoms, but this would depend on the results of any cultures or other diagnostic tests.

After 1 month of ongoing rash, pembrolizumab was discontinued. Her pruritic eruption persisted over the next 5 months despite treatment with up to 80 mg/d of oral prednisone. She did not report fever during this period. A shave biopsy performed while the patient was receiving systemic corticosteroids demonstrated spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate suggesting an incipient autoimmune bullous process. Results of follow-up direct immunofluorescence (DIF) performed on a sample taken 15 days after steroid discontinuation were negative. The eruption continued to worsen when the patient was not receiving systemic corticosteroids, with blisters developing 7.5 weeks after their discontinuation, prompting her presentation to the emergency department.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A.

The patient's symptoms suggest an autoimmune bullous process, which is a group of diseases characterized by blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The initial biopsy suggested this, but the direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was negative. However, it's important to note that the DIF was performed while the patient was on systemic corticosteroids, which could have affected the results. 

Given the persistence and worsening of the patient's symptoms after discontinuation of the corticosteroids, it would be prudent to repeat the biopsy and DIF to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment. 

Starting a different PD-1 inhibitor would not be advisable given the patient's reaction to pembrolizumab. Providing intravenous fluids and wound care in a burn unit may be necessary at some point, but it would not address the underlying issue. Discharging with topical triamcinolone 0.5% cream would also not be sufficient given the severity and persistence of the patient's symptoms.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,The correct answer is: Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF,',"Based on the information provided, I would recommend option 3: Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF.

The patient's persistent pruritic eruption despite treatment with systemic corticosteroids and the negative DIF results suggest that the rash may not be related to an autoimmune bullous process. The shave biopsy results showing spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate are also consistent with a possible drug-related adverse event.

Given the patient's history of cancer and treatment with pembrolizumab, it is important to rule out any potential side effects or complications related to the medication. Repeating the punch biopsy with hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF can help to further evaluate the skin lesions and determine if there are any features suggestive of a drug-related adverse event.

Starting a different PD-1 inhibitor (option 1) may not be appropriate at this time, as the patient has already experienced a severe adverse event with pembrolizumab. Providing intravenous fluids and wound care in a burn unit (option 2) may be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's condition.

Do you think the patient's history of cancer and treatment with pembrolizumab increases the likelihood of a drug-related adverse event?

Answer:

Yes, the patient's history of cancer and treatment with pembrolizumab increases the likelihood of a drug-related adverse event. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor, which is a type of immunotherapy that works by blocking a protein called PD-1 on the surface of T cells. By blocking PD-1, pembrolizumab helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. However, this can also increase the risk of immune-related adverse events, such as skin rashes, diarrhea, and inflammation of organs. The patient's history of cancer and treatment with pembrolizumab suggests that the persistent pruritic eruption may be related to an immune-related adverse event.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771843,"A previously healthy 27-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion. She denied fevers or chills. She was born in Guatemala and had immigrated to the US approximately 1 year ago, without subsequent international travel. She took no medications. On examination, she was afebrile (36.8 °C) and hemodynamically stable, with heart rate 70/min and blood pressure 95/53 mm Hg. She was somnolent and confused without focal neurologic deficits. Serum white blood cell count was elevated to 14.9 ×109/L (86% segmented neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 0% basophils/eosinophils). A computed tomography scan of her brain was notable for diffuse ventriculomegaly and sulcal effacement consistent with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. Given her diminished level of consciousness, a ventriculostomy was placed emergently. Laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the ventriculostomy was notable for 40 red blood cells/mm3; 3 nucleated cells/mm3; protein level, 11 mg/dL; and glucose level, 73 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast demonstrated ventriculomegaly of the lateral and third ventricles, with a 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.6–cm nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius (Figure 1A). No abnormal meningeal enhancement or parenchymal lesion was identified. On hospital day 5, in the midst of an ongoing infectious diseases workup, the measured intracranial pressure and rate of CSF drainage from the ventriculostomy suddenly decreased. Repeat MRI demonstrated resolved hydrocephalus, a patent aqueduct of Sylvius, and the aforementioned nonenhancing lesion now located in the fourth ventricle (Figure 1B).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Observe the patient without intervention', 'B. Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids', 'C. Extract the lesion surgically', 'D. Divert cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt']",C,B,"The correct answer is: Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids.

The patient's symptoms, history of immigration from Guatemala, and imaging findings are suggestive of neurocysticercosis, which is a parasitic infection of the brain caused by the larval cysts of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This condition is common in developing countries and among immigrants from these regions. The cysts can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to hydrocephalus, which seems to be the case in this patient.

The nonenhancing lesion that was initially obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius and then found in the fourth ventricle is likely a cysticercus cyst. The sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and rate of CSF drainage could be due to the cyst moving and no longer causing obstruction.

The treatment of choice for neurocysticercosis is anthelminthic therapy, often with albendazole or praziquantel, along with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation caused by the dying parasites. Surgical removal of the cysts may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment and is usually reserved for cases where medical therapy fails or is not possible.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the MRI findings in the text is sufficient to make a diagnosis and treatment decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to extract the lesion surgically. The patient's symptoms, including headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion, along with the findings on examination and imaging (ventriculomegaly, sulcal effacement, obstructed aqueduct of Sylvius), suggest that the nonenhancing lesion is causing hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. The sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and CSF drainage, along with the resolved hydrocephalus and the presence of the lesion in the fourth ventricle on repeat MRI, further support the need for surgical intervention to remove the lesion.

Justification for choosing this answer:
Surgical extraction of the lesion is necessary to relieve the obstruction and restore normal CSF flow, which will alleviate the symptoms and prevent further complications. This approach is supported by the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Justification for not choosing the other options:
- Observing the patient without intervention would not address the underlying cause of the hydrocephalus and cerebral edema, and could lead to worsening of symptoms and potential complications.
- Initiating anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids may be considered if there is evidence of parasitic infection, but there is no mention of any specific infectious etiology in the provided information.
- Diverting cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered in cases of chronic hydrocephalus, but in this acute setting with a visible lesion causing obstruction, surgical extraction is the more appropriate intervention.

Therefore, a corresponding medical image is not necessary.",B,Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids,B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2, Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids.

The patient's symptoms of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion, along with the physical examination findings of somnolence and confused state, are consistent with a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium. The presence of a nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius, with no abnormal meningeal enhancement or parenchymal lesion, supports this diagnosis. The fact that the patient was born in Guatemala and had immigrated to the US approximately 1 year ago, without subsequent international travel, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as neurocysticercosis is endemic in many developing countries.

Initiating anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids is the appropriate next step in management, as it has been shown to be effective in treating neurocysticercosis. The use of steroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the brain.

Observing the patient without intervention (option 1) would not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings indicate a serious infection that requires prompt treatment. Surgical extraction of the lesion (option 3) may be considered in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management, as the lesion is located in the fourth ventricle and may not be easily accessible surgically. Diverting cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt (option 4) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management, as the patient's hydrocephalus has already resolved with treatment.

The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, persistent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and chronic cough, along with the more recent development of progressive exertional dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities, suggest a possible cardiac or pulmonary issue. The changes in his nails could be related to chronic hypoxia. A thoracic CT scan would help identify any abnormalities in the heart or lungs that could be causing these symptoms.

The other options are less likely to be helpful in this case. Microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution would be more appropriate for a suspected fungal infection, which this patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest. Radiographs of the hands and feet would not be likely to provide useful information given the patient's symptoms. Measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity could be useful in diagnosing iron overload disorders, but again, this patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest such a disorder.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image. So, the answer is <False>.",D,"I would choose to order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity. 

Based on the patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, chronic cough, and the development of thickened, brittle, and discolored fingernails and toenails, it is important to consider a possible underlying systemic condition. The presence of these symptoms along with the development of exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema suggests a potential systemic disease process.

Measuring serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity can help evaluate for iron deficiency anemia, which can present with similar symptoms. Iron deficiency anemia can cause nasal congestion, chronic cough, and nail changes. Additionally, iron deficiency anemia can lead to exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema due to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

Performing microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution may be useful in evaluating for fungal infection of the nails, but it does not address the patient's other symptoms or the possibility of an underlying systemic condition.

Ordering radiographs of hands and feet may be helpful in evaluating for joint abnormalities or bony changes, but it does not address the patient's respiratory symptoms or nail changes.

Ordering a thoracic CT scan may be considered if there were specific respiratory symptoms or findings that warranted further evaluation, such as persistent cough, hemoptysis, or abnormal lung sounds. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and nail changes are more suggestive of a systemic condition rather than a primary respiratory issue.

Therefore, measuring serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient's symptoms and nail changes.",D,"Order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is often associated with conditions like hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. The brittle, discolored nails could be a sign of iron deficiency, which can occur in patients with IPF due to the increased consumption of iron by the inflammatory process in the lungs. Therefore, measuring the serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity can help provide more information about the patient's iron status and potentially help in the diagnosis and management of IPF.",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to order a thoracic CT scan. The patient's persistent nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and chronic cough, as well as their recent development of exertional dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities, suggest the possibility of a respiratory or cardiovascular condition. The patient's history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea also increase the likelihood of a cardiovascular or respiratory diagnosis. A thoracic CT scan would be able to provide information about the patient's lung and cardiovascular health, including any potential issues with the heart, lungs, or blood vessels.

The other options do not seem as relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history. Performing microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution may be useful in diagnosing certain nail disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. Ordering radiographs of hands and feet may be useful in evaluating the patient's bone health, but it is not likely to provide information about the patient's respiratory or cardiovascular health. Ordering a measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity may be useful in diagnosing certain iron-related disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

The patient's symptoms of decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations, along with a history of a childhood heart murmur, suggest a possible cardiac issue. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive test that can provide detailed images of the heart's structure and function, which can help in diagnosing a variety of heart conditions. 

Starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or performing cardiac catheterization would be premature without a definitive diagnosis. Referring to a pulmonologist might be necessary if there were more signs pointing to a pulmonary condition, but the symptoms and history provided suggest a cardiac issue.

The patient's symptoms of chronic lower back pain, bilateral hip pain, hand pain along the MCP and PIP joints, and prolonged morning stiffness are suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis, possibly ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. These conditions often involve the sacroiliac joints, and an MRI of this area can help confirm the diagnosis. 

The family history of osteoarthritis may be relevant, but it does not explain all of the patient's symptoms. Checking ferritin and transferrin saturation would be more relevant if there were suspicion of hemochromatosis, which can also cause arthritis, but this is less likely given the patient's symptoms and family history. Checking rheumatoid factor (RF) could be useful if rheumatoid arthritis were suspected, but this patient's symptoms are not typical for that condition. A surgical consultation would not be the next best step without a more definitive diagnosis.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the most appropriate next step would be to check rheumatoid factor (RF). The patient's symptoms of bilateral hand pain, morning stiffness, and family history of osteoarthritis suggest the possibility of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RF is a blood test that can help in the diagnosis of RA.

Checking ferritin and transferrin saturation would be more relevant in evaluating iron deficiency anemia, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms.

Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joint would be more appropriate if the patient presented with symptoms suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis, such as chronic lower back pain and morning stiffness that improves with exercise. However, the patient's symptoms do not specifically point towards sacroiliitis.

Referring for surgical consultation is not indicated at this stage as the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a rheumatologic condition rather than a surgical one.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,The correct answer is: Check rheumatoid factor (RF),B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to Check rheumatoid factor (RF).

The patient's symptoms of bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, bilateral hip pain, and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes, are consistent with a potential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, the patient's family history of osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes, increases the likelihood of an autoimmune disorder.

The RF test is a blood test that measures the level of antibodies directed against the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in the blood. RF is often elevated in patients with RA and can help support the diagnosis.

Therefore, checking the RF level would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

She had no fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in the stool, or weight loss. She was not taking any medications. On examination, her temperature was 36.9 °C; heart rate, 72/min; blood pressure, 132/68 mm Hg; and body mass index, 25 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Results of complete blood cell count and serum chemistries were unremarkable, with no leukocytosis and normal differential count. Abdominal examination demonstrated mild distention without fluid wave and mild right lower abdomen and suprapubic tenderness. Computed tomography (Figure 1) and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum. Two attempts at ultrasound-guided paracentesis were nondiagnostic because of acellular specimens.

The patient's presentation of generalized abdominal pain and distention, along with the imaging findings of pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum, are concerning for malignancy. Given the patient's history of uterine carcinoma, there is a possibility of metastasis, although it is also possible that this is a new primary malignancy. The elevated CEA level further supports the suspicion of malignancy, as CEA is a tumor marker that can be elevated in various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. 

A colonoscopy with biopsy would allow for direct visualization of the lesion and the opportunity to obtain tissue for histopathological examination, which is the gold standard for diagnosing malignancy. 

The other options are less appropriate. Laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy would be more invasive and may not provide a definitive diagnosis if the lesion is not within the appendix or peritoneum. Repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology may not yield a diagnosis, as the previous two attempts were nondiagnostic. Broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be appropriate as there are no signs of infection (e.g., fever, leukocytosis).

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to order colonoscopy with biopsy. 

The patient's presentation with abdominal pain, distention, and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum on imaging raises suspicion for a possible colonic malignancy. Therefore, a colonoscopy with biopsy would help to visualize the lesion directly and obtain tissue samples for histopathological examination. This would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

Performing a laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy would not be the most appropriate next step, as there is no indication of acute appendicitis or peritoneal involvement in this case.

Ordering repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology may not be helpful, as the previous attempts were nondiagnostic due to acellular specimens. It is unlikely to yield useful information in this scenario.

Ordering broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic enteric species would not be the most appropriate next step, as there is no evidence of infection or peritoneal signs in the patient. Antibiotics should be reserved for cases with clear signs of infection.

Justification: The patient's history of uterine carcinoma, along with the presence of an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum, raises concern for possible colonic malignancy. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing colonic lesions and would provide the most accurate information for further management.

The question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology,B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology.

The patient's history of uterine carcinoma and the presence of pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum suggest the possibility of a recurrent malignancy. The nondiagnostic results of the initial ultrasound-guided paracentesis suggest that a repeat procedure may be necessary to obtain a diagnostic sample. Additionally, the elevated CEA level (18 ng/mL) compared to the normal reference range (<5 ng/mL) supports the possibility of a malignancy.

Therefore, to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the cause of the ascites and enhancing lesion, I would recommend repeating the image-guided paracentesis/cytology to obtain a diagnostic sample for further analysis. This approach would allow for a more accurate diagnosis and guide further management decisions.

Justification for the answer:

The patient's history of uterine carcinoma and the presence of pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum suggest the possibility of a recurrent malignancy. The nondiagnostic results of the initial ultrasound-guided paracentesis suggest that a repeat procedure may be necessary to obtain a diagnostic sample. Additionally, the elevated CEA level (18 ng/mL) compared to the normal reference range (<5 ng/mL) supports the possibility of a malignancy.

Repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology would allow for a more accurate diagnosis and guide further management decisions. This approach is less invasive than laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy (option 1) and may provide a faster diagnosis than colonoscopy with biopsy (option 3). Broad-spectrum antibiotics (option 4) may be necessary if an infection is suspected, but they would not provide a diagnosis for the patient's symptoms.

Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine']",D,D,"The correct choice would be to ""Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine"". 

The patient's symptoms of pain, color changes, and ulcerations in the fingertips, along with dryness of the eyes and mouth, hair loss, and mild esophageal dysphagia, suggest a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). This is a connective tissue disease characterized by skin thickening and involvement of internal organs. Raynaud's phenomenon, which is an exaggerated vascular response to cold temperature or stress, is often the first symptom and can lead to digital ulcers as seen in this patient. 

Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a first-line treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon associated with systemic sclerosis. It works by causing vasodilation, which increases blood flow to the affected areas and can help heal the digital ulcers and alleviate the associated pain.

The other options are not as suitable. Intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy are not typically first-line treatments for systemic sclerosis or Raynaud's phenomenon. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin is not indicated unless there is evidence of a thrombotic event, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to give intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone. 

This patient's symptoms, including pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips, along with hair loss, dryness of the eyes and mouth, and mild esophageal dysphagia, are suggestive of a connective tissue disorder, specifically systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). 

In systemic sclerosis, there is an autoimmune process leading to fibrosis and vascular abnormalities. The involvement of the fingertips, known as digital ischemia, is a common manifestation of this condition. Treatment typically involves immunosuppressive therapy, such as high-dose corticosteroids like methylprednisolone, to reduce inflammation and prevent further tissue damage.

Initiating therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as there is no evidence of thrombosis or embolism. 

Starting empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy would not be indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of infection.

Starting vasodilator therapy with nifedipine may be considered in the long-term management of systemic sclerosis to improve blood flow and reduce symptoms, but it would not be the most appropriate initial step in this acute presentation.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms, the most appropriate next step would be to start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine. The patient's symptoms of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips, along with hair loss, dryness of the eyes and mouth, and mild esophageal dysphagia, are suggestive of scleroderma. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can help to relax the blood vessels and improve blood flow, which can alleviate some of the symptoms associated with scleroderma. 

Giving intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone would not be the first-line treatment for scleroderma, as it can have significant side effects and is usually reserved for more severe cases. Initiating therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin would not be appropriate, as there is no indication of a thrombotic disorder. Starting empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy would not be appropriate, as there is no indication of an infection.",B,"Based on the symptoms described, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. The patient's symptoms of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips of both hands, as well as the report of hair loss, dryness of the eyes and mouth, and mild esophageal dysphagia, suggest the possibility of a connective tissue disorder such as systemic sclerosis or vasculitis. The risk of pulmonary embolism and renal involvement is also high in these conditions, making anticoagulation therapy appropriate.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible connective tissue disorder, which can lead to vessel inflammation and clotting. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin can help prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism and renal involvement.

However, without more specific information about her condition, such as imaging results, lab tests, or response to any treatments so far, it's not clear what the most appropriate next step would be.

1. Changing antimicrobial therapy to meropenem and vancomycin would be appropriate if she had a severe bacterial infection that wasn't responding to current treatment, but there's no specific information suggesting this is the case.

This is because the patient presents with a productive cough, weight loss, subjective fevers, and worsening chest pain, which are concerning for a possible respiratory infection. Given the patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes and smoking, there is an increased risk of developing severe infections, including pneumonia. Meropenem and vancomycin provide broad-spectrum coverage against a wide range of pathogens, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Changing voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B would be more appropriate if there were evidence of a fungal infection, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",A,"Based on the given information, the patient is presenting with symptoms that suggest a serious infection, possibly tuberculosis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to change the antimicrobial therapy to meropenem and vancomycin. These antibiotics are commonly used to treat tuberculosis and other serious bacterial infections. 

Voriconazole is an antifungal medication and is not appropriate for treating bacterial infections. Therefore, changing voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B would not be the correct next step. 

Consulting radiation oncology immediately is not appropriate as there is no indication that the patient has cancer. 

Performing a right upper lobe resection is a surgical procedure that is not appropriate for treating a bacterial infection. 

Therefore, the correct answer is to change antimicrobial therapy to meropenem and vancomycin.",D,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 4, Perform right upper lobe resection.

The patient's symptoms of productive cough, weight loss, subjective fevers, and worsening chest pain, along with their history of smoking and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. The patient's history of chronic pain from osteoarthritis treated with inhalational medical marijuana may also suggest a possible diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

A right upper lobe resection would be an appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it would allow for a definitive diagnosis of lung cancer or COPD, as well as potentially providing symptomatic relief for the patient's chest pain and cough.

I would not choose option 1, Change antimicrobial therapy to meropenem and vancomycin, as there is no indication of a bacterial infection in the patient's symptoms or medical history. Option 2, Change voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B, may be appropriate if the patient had a fungal infection, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or symptoms.

The patient's symptoms, including persistent joint pain, elevated inflammatory markers, intermittent fevers, and significant unintentional weight loss, are concerning for a systemic process such as malignancy. Rheumatoid arthritis itself is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, and the patient's lack of sustained response to multiple therapies raises the suspicion for an alternative or additional diagnosis. Hematologic malignancies, such as lymphoma, can present with systemic symptoms including fevers, weight loss, and elevated inflammatory markers. Therefore, it would be prudent to perform a genetic analysis to evaluate for a potential hematologic malignancy.

The other options are less likely. Antimicrobial therapy would be considered if there was a suspicion of infection, but the patient's symptoms are not specific to an infectious process. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is typically used for conditions like immune deficiencies or certain neurological disorders, which don't seem to be the case here. A gluten-free diet is recommended for conditions like celiac disease, but the patient's symptoms don't strongly suggest this diagnosis.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform genetic analysis for evaluation of hematologic malignancy. The patient's symptoms, including persistent joint pain, elevated inflammatory markers, intermittent fevers, unintentional weight loss, and polyarthralgias, are concerning for an underlying hematologic malignancy. These symptoms, along with the patient's age, warrant further investigation to rule out any potential malignancy.

Antimicrobial therapy would not be the first choice as there is no clear indication of an infectious process in the patient's presentation.

This is a chronic immune system disease in which a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the lining of the esophagus. The symptoms often include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and food getting stuck in the esophagus. The EGD findings of vertical furrows and circumferential rings are also characteristic of EoE.

The first-line treatment for EoE is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as omeprazole. PPIs reduce the production of stomach acid, which can help reduce eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus. The patient's symptoms did not improve with ranitidine, which is a less potent acid reducer, so a trial of a PPI is a reasonable next step.

The other options are less appropriate. A barium esophagram and high-resolution manometry (HRM) are diagnostic tests that might be useful if the diagnosis was unclear, but in this case, the EGD findings are quite suggestive of EoE. Surgical fundoplication is a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), not EoE.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the EGD findings is sufficient to suggest a diagnosis of EoE. So, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), the most appropriate next step would be to perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM). HRM is a diagnostic test that measures the pressure and coordination of the muscles in the esophagus. It can help identify motility disorders such as achalasia or esophageal spasm, which can cause dysphagia.

The patient's symptoms of intermittent dysphagia to solids, along with the presence of vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus on EGD, suggest the possibility of a motility disorder. Therefore, performing HRM would provide more information about the esophageal motility and help guide further management.

Prescribing omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) may be considered if there were symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) such as heartburn or if there were signs of esophagitis on EGD. However, since the patient does not have these symptoms or findings, omeprazole would not be the most appropriate next step.

Referring for surgical fundoplication would be premature at this stage, as the patient has not been evaluated for GERD or motility disorders. Surgical intervention is typically reserved for cases where medical management has failed or when there is a confirmed diagnosis that requires surgical intervention.

Ordering a barium esophagram may provide additional information about the anatomy and function of the esophagus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. HRM is a more specific test for evaluating esophageal motility disorders.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,"I would perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM). 

The patient has presented with symptoms of dysphagia, and the EGD has revealed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus. These findings are suggestive of esophageal rings, which can cause difficulty swallowing. Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) is a diagnostic test that can help to evaluate the function of the esophagus and identify any abnormalities. This test can provide important information about the patient's condition and help to guide treatment decisions.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2, Perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM).

The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening intermittent dysphagia, primarily to solids, especially meats, localized retrosternally, suggest a possible esophageal motility disorder. The presence of vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus on EGD supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms persist despite treatment with ranitidine, which suggests that the symptoms may not be related to acid reflux.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) is a diagnostic test that measures the muscle contractions of the esophagus and can help diagnose esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia or jackhammer esophagus. HRM can also help identify any abnormalities in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) or the esophageal body.

Therefore, I would recommend performing esophageal HRM to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of her dysphagia.

Justification:

* Ordering a barium esophagram (option 1) may help identify any anatomical abnormalities in the esophagus, but it would not provide information on the muscle contractions of the esophagus, which is the primary concern in this patient's case.
* Prescribing omeprazole (option 3) may help alleviate symptoms of acid reflux, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's dysphagia.
* Referring for surgical fundoplication (option 4) would be inappropriate at this time, as it is a surgical procedure that is typically reserved for patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or achalasia, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest these conditions.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest that she may be experiencing a recurrent episode of Fixed Drug Eruption (FDE), a type of drug allergy characterized by skin reactions that recur in the same location whenever the patient is exposed to the offending drug. In this case, the offending drug appears to be ibuprofen, as the patient experienced a similar reaction after taking ibuprofen in the past. 

Discontinuing ibuprofen would be the first step in managing this condition. If the patient's symptoms resolve after discontinuing ibuprofen, this would further support the diagnosis of FDE. 

The other options are less likely to be beneficial. Administering valacyclovir would be appropriate if the patient's symptoms were due to herpes simplex virus, but this is less likely given the patient's history and the absence of other typical signs of herpes, such as fever or swollen lymph nodes. Discontinuing all cosmetics could be considered if contact dermatitis was suspected, but the patient's history and symptoms are more consistent with FDE. Administering antibiotics would not be appropriate unless there was evidence of a secondary bacterial infection, which is not suggested by the information provided.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores). The patient's previous episode of a similar eruption after taking a cold medication containing ibuprofen suggests a possible trigger for the recurrence.

The next step would be to administer valacyclovir, an antiviral medication commonly used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. Valacyclovir can help reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as prevent future outbreaks.

Discontinuing all cosmetics or administering antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral infection rather than an allergic reaction or bacterial infection.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image to answer.",C,The correct answer is: Discontinue ibuprofen,C,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to discontinue ibuprofen. The patient has a history of a similar eruption at the same site with spontaneous resolution after taking a cold medication containing ibuprofen, suggesting that the current eruption may be related to the medication.

The patient's history of recurrent venous thromboembolism, along with his current symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias, could suggest a coagulation disorder. Additional coagulation tests would help to confirm or rule out this possibility. 

A bone marrow biopsy is not immediately indicated based on the information given. Administering prothrombin complex concentrate would be premature without further testing, as it is typically used to reverse the effects of anticoagulant medications, which the patient is nonadherent with. Vitamin C supplementation could be beneficial for general health, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or medical history.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to order additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay). 

The patient's presentation with fatigue, weakness, arthralgias, and a history of recurrent venous thromboembolism suggests a possible underlying coagulation disorder.

This would provide valuable information for further management and treatment decisions.

A bone marrow biopsy would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as there is no indication or information provided to suggest a need for it.

Administering prothrombin complex concentrate would not be appropriate without first determining the cause of the patient's symptoms and abnormal coagulation profile.

The patient's history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism, along with his symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias, suggest a possible deficiency in Vitamin C. Vitamin C is important for the biosynthesis of collagen, the maintenance of cartilage, and the repair of tissues. It can also help reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism. Therefore, initiating Vitamin C supplementation would be the most appropriate next step.

Additional coagulation tests could be considered, but since the patient has a history of psychosis and is nonadherent to medications, it is more likely that Vitamin C deficiency is the underlying cause of his symptoms rather than a coagulation disorder. A bone marrow biopsy would not be necessary for this case, and prothrombin complex concentrate is usually administered in cases of severe bleeding or clotting disorders, which is not indicated in this scenario.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to Order additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay).

The patient's history of recurrent venous thromboembolism suggests a possible bleeding disorder, and the recent fall and fatigue could be indicative of a bleeding episode. The patient's nonadherence to medications and denial of drug and alcohol abuse suggest that the cause of the bleeding may not be related to substance abuse or medication noncompliance.

A bone marrow biopsy (Option 1) may be necessary later on to evaluate for hematological disorders such as myeloproliferative neoplasms or myelodysplastic syndrome, but it is not the most urgent step at this point.

Administering prothrombin complex concentrate (Option 2) may be appropriate if the patient has a confirmed bleeding disorder, but it is not the first step in evaluating the patient's symptoms.

Initiating vitamin C supplementation (Option 3) is not directly related to the patient's presenting symptoms and medical history.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2753853,"A 30-year-old man presented to the emergency department with palpitations and tachycardia. He had been experiencing sore throat, fevers, and myalgias for the past day. He became alarmed when he awoke from sleep with strong palpitations and a heart rate greater than 200/min documented on his smartwatch. He had similar symptoms 1 year ago and was diagnosed with and treated for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). A subsequent outpatient echocardiogram revealed a structurally normal heart; results of a follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) were also normal (Figure 1, top).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous amiodarone', 'B. Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J', 'C. Switch to intravenous esmolol drip', 'D. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil']",D,C,"The correct answer would be: Switch to intravenous esmolol drip.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a recurrence of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Esmolol is a short-acting beta blocker that is often used in emergency situations to control heart rate in SVT. It is preferred over diltiazem in this case because the patient's symptoms have not improved with diltiazem, suggesting that a different approach is needed. 

Amiodarone is generally reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias or when other treatments have failed, and it has a risk of serious side effects. Direct current cardioversion is typically a last resort when medication is ineffective, and there's no indication that this is the case here. Verapamil, like diltiazem, is a calcium channel blocker, and since the patient's symptoms have not improved with diltiazem, it's unlikely that switching to another calcium channel blocker would be beneficial.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to stop the diltiazem drip and administer intravenous adenosine. Adenosine is the drug of choice for terminating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and is effective in converting the rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm. It is given as a rapid intravenous bolus followed by a saline flush. Adenosine works by temporarily blocking conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, interrupting the re-entry circuit responsible for SVT.

The other options listed are not the first-line treatment for SVT. Intravenous amiodarone, esmolol, and verapamil may be considered in certain situations, but adenosine is the preferred initial treatment.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,The correct answer is: Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil,B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J.

The patient's symptoms of palpitations and tachycardia, along with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), suggest that they are experiencing a recurrent episode of SVT. The patient's heart rate, as documented on their smartwatch, is also consistent with SVT.

The first option, stopping diltiazem drip and administering intravenous amiodarone, may not be effective in converting the arrhythmia, as the patient has already been treated with diltiazem and the arrhythmia has not resolved. Amiodarone may also take longer to take effect compared to cardioversion.

The third option, switching to intravenous esmolol drip, may not be appropriate as the patient's arrhythmia is not controlled by medications and may require a more immediate intervention such as cardioversion.

The fourth option, stopping diltiazem drip and administering intravenous verapamil, may also not be effective in converting the arrhythmia, as verapamil may take longer to take effect compared to cardioversion.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J, as it has been shown to be effective in converting SVT in similar cases.

Justification:

The decision to repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J is based on the patient's history of SVT and the persistence of the arrhythmia despite previous treatment with diltiazem. Cardioversion has been shown to be effective in converting SVT in similar cases, and repeating the procedure may be necessary to achieve successful conversion.

Medical image:

Yes, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of SVT and to assess the effectiveness of the cardioversion. Additionally, an echocardiogram may be useful to evaluate the structural heart disease.

Therefore, the answer is:

2. Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J.

Justification:
The decision is based on the patient's history of SVT, the persistence of the arrhythmia despite previous treatment with diltiazem, and the effectiveness of cardioversion in converting SVT in similar cases.

The patient's history of immigration from Micronesia, a region with high prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, and her symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain suggest a possible diagnosis of ascariasis, a parasitic infection caused by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. 

The diagnosis of ascariasis is typically confirmed by identifying Ascaris eggs in stool. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms suggest possible hepatobiliary ascariasis, a complication of ascariasis in which the worms migrate from the small intestine to the biliary tract. In such cases, stool examination may be negative for Ascaris eggs, and serologic testing can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis.

Prescribing anthelminthic therapy or antibiotics without confirming the diagnosis could potentially lead to unnecessary treatment and side effects. Ordering a PCR assay for Ascaris could also be an option, but it is not as widely available or as well validated as serologic testing for this purpose.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to order serum serologic testing for Ascaris.

Ordering serum serologic testing for Ascaris can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Prescribing anthelminthic therapy alone or prescribing antibiotics followed by anthelminthic therapy without confirming the diagnosis through testing would be premature and may not be necessary if the patient does not have an Ascaris infection.

Ordering a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris may be a more specific diagnostic test, but it is not the initial step in the evaluation of this patient. Serum serologic testing is a more commonly used and readily available test for Ascaris.

The patient's symptoms of progressive right upper quadrant abdominal pain, sharp and intermittent without radiation, are consistent with a possible parasitic infection. The patient's history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and immigration from Chuuk, Micronesia, to Hawaii 10 years ago, increases the likelihood of a parasitic infection. Ascaris is a common parasite found in Micronesia, and the patient's lack of travel overseas since moving to Hawaii suggests that the infection was likely acquired in Micronesia.

A PCR assay for Ascaris would be the most appropriate next step because it is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting Ascaris infections. It can detect the presence of Ascaris eggs or larvae in the patient's stool or serum, which would confirm the diagnosis.

Prescribing anthelminthic therapy alone without proper diagnosis may not be effective in treating the underlying infection, and may also lead to adverse reactions. Similarly, prescribing antibiotics followed by anthelminthic therapy may not be effective in treating a parasitic infection, and may also contribute to antibiotic resistance. Serum serologic testing for Ascaris may not be as sensitive or specific as a PCR assay, and may not be able to detect early stages of the infection.

The patient's symptoms of purpuric patches, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and lower extremity edema, along with the recurrence and spread of the patches, suggest a possible cryoglobulinemia, which is a condition characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins that by definition precipitate from the serum at temperatures below 37°C (98.6°F) and redissolve upon warming. Cryoglobulins can cause a variety of syndromes, collectively known as cryoglobulinemia. 

Cryoglobulinemia can be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders such as the patient's extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The fact that the purpuric patches initially improved with chemotherapy but then recurred more extensively suggests that the underlying lymphoma may not be fully controlled, leading to the production of more cryoglobulins. 

Therefore, testing for serum cryoglobulin level would be the next appropriate step in this patient's management. If the test is positive, it would confirm the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia and guide further treatment.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to test for the serum cryoglobulin level.

The patient's chronic joint pain and stiffness, along with the presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae, and the significantly elevated protein level in his urine, suggest a systemic disorder. The absence of inflammation (normal ESR and C-reactive protein levels) and the presence of proteinuria suggest a possible monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). MGRS is a group of disorders characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulins that can cause kidney damage. Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay are used to detect abnormal proteins in the blood, which can indicate conditions such as multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, which can be associated with MGRS.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's presentation. A bone scan would be more appropriate if there was suspicion of metastatic disease or certain types of arthritis, but the patient's symptoms and lab results do not strongly suggest these conditions. Methotrexate is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases, but again, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not strongly suggest these conditions. A temporal artery biopsy would be used to diagnose giant cell arteritis, but the patient does not have symptoms such as headaches or vision changes that would suggest this condition.

The patient's history of chronic joint pain and stiffness, along with the presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae, suggests the possibility of an underlying systemic condition. The normal results for complete blood cell count, ESR, and levels of electrolytes, creatinine, and C-reactive protein make inflammatory arthritis and infection less likely. However, the presence of proteinuria (elevated protein levels in the urine) suggests the possibility of a systemic disorder affecting multiple organ systems.

Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay are tests used to evaluate for monoclonal gammopathies, such as multiple myeloma. These conditions can present with joint pain, soft tissue masses, and proteinuria. Therefore, ordering these tests would help to further evaluate the patient's condition and guide further management.

A bone scan would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and findings are not suggestive of a bone pathology.

Starting methotrexate would not be appropriate at this point, as there is no evidence to support an inflammatory arthritis diagnosis. Additionally, further evaluation is needed before initiating any specific treatment.

Performing a temporal artery biopsy would not be indicated in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms or findings suggestive of temporal arteritis. Temporal artery biopsy is typically performed in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis, which presents with headache, vision changes, and temporal artery tenderness.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,"Order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay. 

The patient's presentation of chronic joint pain and stiffness, along with the presence of raised soft tissue masses and abnormal urinalysis, suggests the possibility of a systemic autoimmune disease, such as multiple myeloma or rheumatoid arthritis. Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay can help evaluate for the presence of monoclonal proteins, which can be indicative of multiple myeloma. It is important to further evaluate this possibility before considering other interventions such as starting methotrexate or performing a temporal artery biopsy. A bone scan is not necessary at this time as the patient has no symptoms suggestive of bone metastases.",B,"Based on the patient's history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and the presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae, I would order a serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay. This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disorder that can cause joint pain and stiffness, skin rashes, and abnormalities in blood tests. The presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae is also consistent with SLE, as it can cause lymphadenopathy and organ enlargement.

Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay can help support the diagnosis of SLE by identifying abnormalities in the levels and patterns of immunoglobulins and light chains in the blood. Specifically, SLE patients often have elevated levels of IgG and IgA, and a high ratio of IgG to IgM. Additionally, the presence of free light chains in the blood can indicate immunoglobulin synthesis and degradation, which is a hallmark of SLE.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the laboratory results showing abnormal protein levels in the urine, suggest a possible diagnosis of SLE. Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay can help support this diagnosis by identifying abnormalities in immunoglobulin levels and patterns, which are characteristic of SLE. Therefore, it is appropriate to order these tests as the next step in the patient's evaluation.

Her breast cancer was diagnosed in 2007 as stage IA estrogen-receptor positive, progesterone-receptor negative (ER+, PR−), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2) negative, initially treated with lumpectomy plus left breast radiotherapy followed by doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and anastrazole. In 2017, metastases were found in the lumbar spine and lung and treated with fulvestrant and palbociclib plus left brachial plexus radiotherapy.

The patient's symptoms of painless reduced vision in one eye could be due to a number of causes, including metastasis to the brain or orbits, which is a common site of metastasis for breast cancer. An MRI of the head and orbits would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for possible metastatic disease in these areas. 

The other options are less likely to be the correct next step without more information. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids might be used if there was suspicion of inflammatory or autoimmune causes, but these are less likely in this patient with known metastatic cancer. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used for conditions like age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, which there's no indication of here. Stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab could be considered if there was suspicion that these were causing the vision loss, but again, metastasis would be a more likely cause in this patient.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the patient's presentation of painless reduced vision in her right eye (OD), the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits. This will help evaluate the cause of the vision loss and determine if there are any abnormalities in the brain or eye structures that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication would be more appropriate if there were signs of inflammation or optic neuritis, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

Injecting intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into both eyes would be indicated if there were evidence of neovascularization or macular edema, which are not described in the patient's case.

Stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab would not be the initial step in managing the patient's vision loss. It is important to first evaluate the cause of the symptoms before considering any changes to the current treatment regimen.

In this case, an MRI of the head and orbits is necessary to further investigate the cause of the patient's reduced vision.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits. This is because the patient is presenting with reduced vision in her right eye, which could be related to the metastatic breast cancer or the treatment she is currently receiving. An MRI can help to identify any potential brain metastases or other structural abnormalities that may be causing the visual symptoms. It is important to fully evaluate the patient's condition before making any changes to her treatment plan. Therefore, initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication, injecting intravitreal anti-VEGF into both eyes, or stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab would not be appropriate next steps without further diagnostic testing.",C,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits.

The patient's symptoms of painless reduced vision in her right eye (OD) could be indicative of a number of potential causes, including a metastasis to the brain or orbit. Given the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, it is important to rule out any potential intracranial or orbital metastases. MRI of the head and orbits would be the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate for these possibilities.

Initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication without further evaluation could potentially mask the symptoms and make it more difficult to diagnose the underlying cause. Injecting intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into both eyes would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a vitreomacular traction or retinal vein occlusion, which are the primary indications for this treatment. Stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab without further evaluation and diagnosis could potentially compromise the patient's cancer treatment.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits.

Justify:

The question does not explicitly state that a medical image is required; however, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is highly likely that an MRI of the head and orbits would be necessary to evaluate for potential intracranial or orbital metastases.

He had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. His medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. His left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass', 'B. Excise the mass', 'C. Order breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'D. Send hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia']",A,A,"The correct next step would be to ""Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass"". 

The patient presents with a firm, non-tender mass in the left breast with nipple retraction, which is a concerning sign for malignancy. The mammogram and ultrasound findings further support the suspicion of a malignant process. Therefore, a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. 

Excision of the mass without a prior biopsy is not the standard approach, as the pathology of the mass is not yet confirmed. Ordering a breast MRI could be considered, but it is not the immediate next step and would not replace the need for a biopsy. Sending a hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia is not appropriate in this case, as the clinical and imaging findings are more suggestive of malignancy than gynecomastia.

The question does not necessarily need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description of the findings is sufficient to guide the decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. This is necessary to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation and to determine the nature of the mass. The patient's risk factors, such as being African American, having a family history of cancer, and being a current smoker, increase the suspicion for malignancy. Therefore, a biopsy is crucial to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered in certain cases, such as when there is a high suspicion for malignancy but the mammogram and ultrasound results are inconclusive. However, in this case, the mammogram and ultrasound findings are suggestive of an irregular hypoechoic mass, which raises concern for malignancy. Therefore, proceeding with a biopsy is more appropriate at this stage.

Hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia is not indicated in this case. Gynecomastia typically presents as a bilateral, symmetrical enlargement of the breast tissue and is not associated with a palpable mass. The presence of a firm mass in the left breast, along with the other risk factors and imaging findings, warrants further investigation for malignancy rather than gynecomastia.

Justification for the need for a corresponding medical image: True. In this case, the description of the mammogram and ultrasound findings is crucial in making an appropriate decision.",A,Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass,C,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 3: Order breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the mammography and ultrasound results, suggest a possible diagnosis of breast cancer.

An MRI can provide additional information about the size, location, and extent of the mass, as well as any potential involvement of the surrounding tissue. This information would be valuable in determining the appropriate treatment approach, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

Performing a percutaneous biopsy (option 1) may not provide sufficient tissue for a definitive diagnosis, and excision of the mass (option 2) may not be appropriate at this stage without further evaluation. Hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia (option 4) is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.

However, based on the patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations without chest pain, these symptoms could suggest a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. 

1. Frequent atrial ectopic beats: These are extra beats originating from the atria, which could cause palpitations but usually don't cause fatigue and dizziness unless they are very frequent or the patient has an underlying heart disease.
2. Atrial fibrillation: This is a common cause of palpitations in older adults, especially those with hypertension. It can also cause fatigue and dizziness due to irregular and often rapid heart rate.
3. Atrial flutter with varying AV block: This can also cause similar symptoms as atrial fibrillation due to rapid and irregular heart rate.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: This is a less common cause of palpitations, but can occur in people with serious underlying conditions like lung disease, heart disease, or severe electrolyte abnormalities.

Without the ECG image, it's impossible to make a definitive choice. However, given the patient's age and history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation would be a common and likely possibility. 

To answer your last question, yes, the corresponding medical image (ECG) is absolutely necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in this case. So, the answer is <True>.",B,"Based on the information provided, the next step would be to review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation. 

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm with no discernible P waves and an irregular ventricular response. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations are consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

Reviewing the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation would help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. 

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of increasing fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations, which could be indicative of an arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation is a common type of arrhythmia in older patients with hypertension, and it can cause these symptoms.

If atrial fibrillation is confirmed, the patient may need further evaluation and treatment, such as medication to control the rate and rhythm of the heart.",B,"Based on the given information, the best course of action would be to review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat, often accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations. The patient's history of hypertension and the absence of chest pain suggest that the underlying cause of his symptoms is likely related to a cardiac arrhythmia rather than a coronary event.

The ECG shows a irregular rhythm with no visible P waves, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it is appropriate to choose option B, ""Review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation.""

The patient's history of tobacco use, symptoms of chronic cough and dyspnea, and the findings of emphysema and bronchiectasis on imaging are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, her relatively young age and the severity of her disease raise the possibility of an underlying genetic disorder that predisposes to early-onset COPD. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause COPD in individuals as young as their early 40s, and it is often associated with lower lobe predominant emphysema, as seen in this patient. Therefore, assessing the serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype would be the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation.

The other options are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy is typically reserved for cases where there is suspicion of lung cancer or other specific lung diseases, which is not the case here. Inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing would be more appropriate for a patient with symptoms suggestive of primary ciliary dyskinesia, such as chronic sinusitis or infertility, which this patient does not have. Sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening would be more appropriate for a patient with symptoms suggestive of cystic fibrosis, such as recurrent respiratory infections and pancreatic insufficiency, which again, this patient does not have.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the findings on imaging is sufficient to make the appropriate clinical decision. So, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype. 

The patient's history of tobacco use, progressive cough, dyspnea, and findings of severe obstruction on pulmonary function testing with emphysema and bronchiectasis suggest a possible diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). AATD is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, which leads to unopposed protease activity and subsequent destruction of lung tissue.

Assessing serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype can help confirm the diagnosis of AATD. A low serum α1-antitrypsin level and/or identification of specific genetic mutations associated with AATD would support the diagnosis. This information is crucial for appropriate management and counseling of the patient.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy may be considered in certain cases to evaluate for other causes of bronchiectasis or to assess for infection, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this patient.

Inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing would be more relevant if the patient had symptoms suggestive of primary ciliary dyskinesia, such as neonatal respiratory distress, persistent nasal congestion, or recurrent sinusitis. However, these symptoms are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Assessing sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening would be more appropriate if the patient had symptoms suggestive of cystic fibrosis, such as chronic respiratory infections, pancreatic insufficiency, or failure to thrive. However, these symptoms are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Justification: The patient's history, clinical presentation, and pulmonary function testing findings suggest a possible diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).

The question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,"Assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype

The patient has presented with symptoms and a history that are consistent with emphysema. Before proceeding with any invasive tests or treatments, it would be important to first assess her serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype. This is because deficiency of this protein can cause emphysema, and knowing this information can help guide treatment decisions. The other options listed may be considered after this initial assessment, depending on the results.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination results, the most appropriate next step would be to assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype. The patient's history of tobacco use and symptoms of progressive cough and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of scattered wheezes and rhonchi, are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's age and smoking history also increase the likelihood of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is a common genetic disorder that can contribute to the development of COPD, especially in individuals with a history of tobacco use.

Therefore, the best next step would be to order a serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype to determine if the patient has this deficiency. This information will help guide further management and treatment decisions.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis:

Two days later, he returned with worsening oral lesions, painful phonation, poor oral intake, odynophagia, and new painful penile lesions. He denied any abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, arthralgia, fatigue, vision changes, or skin rashes. He reported a similar episode of widespread oral lesions 18 months earlier that was less severe and self-resolving.

Test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies', 'C. Prescribe oral azithromycin', 'D. Prescribe oral suspension nystatin']",C,A,"The correct action to take next would be to ""Perform upper endoscopy and colonoscopy"". 

The patient's symptoms suggest a more systemic issue than just HSV. The worsening oral lesions, painful phonation, poor oral intake, odynophagia, and new painful penile lesions, despite treatment with acyclovir, indicate that there might be an underlying immunodeficiency or systemic disease. The fact that he had a similar episode 18 months earlier that was less severe and self-resolving also suggests a recurring or chronic condition. 

Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy can help identify any gastrointestinal involvement, which is common in systemic diseases. It can also help rule out other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, which can present with similar symptoms.

Testing for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies is usually done to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus, but the patient's symptoms don't strongly suggest this condition. 

Prescribing oral azithromycin or oral suspension nystatin would only be treating the symptoms, not identifying the underlying cause. 

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. So, the answer is <False>.",,"Based on the patient's presentation and history, the most appropriate next step would be to prescribe oral acyclovir. The patient has a known diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and is experiencing worsening oral lesions and new painful penile lesions. Acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV infections and can help alleviate symptoms and promote healing.

Performing upper endoscopy and colonoscopy is not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest any gastrointestinal involvement.

Testing for anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies is not necessary as the patient's symptoms and history are not suggestive of an autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Prescribing oral azithromycin or oral suspension nystatin is not appropriate in this case as these medications are not indicated for the treatment of HSV infections.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to test for anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. This is because the patient's symptoms are suggestive of a possible autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can cause oral and genital lesions, fever, and nonproductive cough. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies are a specific type of autoantibody that can be present in patients with SLE. If the test is positive, further evaluation and management for SLE would be necessary. 

Prescribing oral azithromycin or oral suspension nystatin would not be appropriate as they are antibiotics and antifungal medications, respectively, and there is no indication that the patient has a bacterial or fungal infection. Performing upper endoscopy and colonoscopy would also not be appropriate as there is no indication that the patient has a gastrointestinal issue.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies.

The patient's symptoms of widespread oral lesions, fever, and nonproductive cough, as well as the recent onset of painful penile lesions, suggest a possible diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) esophagitis. This is a rare complication of HSV infection that can cause significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated.

Testing for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis of HSV esophagitis, as it can detect the presence of HSV antigens in the esophageal tissue. This test is specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of HSV esophagitis, and can help guide treatment decisions.

Performing upper endoscopy and colonoscopy may be necessary later on to visualize the esophageal lesions and assess their severity, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point. Prescribing oral azithromycin or nystatin may be appropriate for treating any potential bacterial or fungal infections, but it is not directly related to the patient's primary symptoms and medical history.

The patient's symptoms are not specific and do not point to a clear diagnosis. However, given his history of nephrolithiasis and the location of his pain, a kidney stone could be a possibility. 

However, the question does not provide an option to perform imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scan, which would be the most appropriate next steps to visualize any potential kidney stones or other abnormalities. 

Therefore, based on the given options, I would return None as none of the provided options are the most appropriate next step based on the patient's presentation.

The justification for the answer is based on the patient's history and current symptoms. An imaging study would be more helpful in this case to visualize the kidneys and urinary tract, which is not among the given options.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an interventional radiology-guided biopsy of the mass. 

The patient's presentation with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain, along with a history of nephrolithiasis, suggests the possibility of a kidney stone blocking the kidney. However, the absence of other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss makes it less likely that the pain is solely due to a kidney stone. 

The physical examination findings of mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound, along with the absence of costovertebral angle tenderness, do not strongly support the presence of a kidney stone. 

Given the patient's history of a splenectomy following blunt trauma, it is important to consider other potential causes of the abdominal pain. The presence of a mass raises concern for a possible tumor or other pathology. Therefore, performing an interventional radiology-guided biopsy of the mass would be the most appropriate next step to further evaluate and determine the nature of the mass. 

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"Based on the given information, the next appropriate step would be to perform an interventional radiology-guided biopsy of the mass. 

The reason for choosing this answer is that the patient has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis, which puts him at risk for kidney stones. However, the absence of other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss makes it difficult to confirm the diagnosis of a kidney stone. Therefore, a biopsy would be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's abdominal pain and to rule out any other potential causes.

The other options, such as performing an EGD, diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings, or an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass, would not be appropriate at this stage as they are invasive procedures that carry risks and complications. An interventional radiology-guided biopsy, on the other hand, is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide valuable diagnostic information with minimal risk.

In conclusion, based on the given information, an interventional radiology-guided biopsy of the mass would be the most appropriate next step.",B,"Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings.

The patient's symptoms of left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain, along with his history of nephrolithiasis, suggest the possibility of a kidney stone or other renal pathology. The absence of other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss suggests that the patient is unlikely to have a severe infection or inflammation.

A diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings would allow for visualization of the kidneys and surrounding tissues, and would also allow for the collection of fluid and/or tissue samples for further analysis. This would help to confirm or rule out the presence of a kidney stone or other renal pathology, and would also allow for the evaluation of the patient's splenectomy scar.

Performing an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass would be a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary at this stage, especially given the patient's history of previous abdominal surgery. An interventional radiology–guided biopsy of the mass may also be considered, but would likely require additional imaging studies to localize the mass and guide the biopsy.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) would not be the most appropriate next step, as it is primarily used to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal tract and would not provide information about the patient's kidneys or abdominal pain.

Justify: True. A diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings would likely require the use of imaging studies, such as ultrasound or CT scans, to guide the procedure and ensure that the appropriate area is being evaluated.",jama

The patient's symptoms of anisocoria that is more pronounced in bright light, along with a poorly reactive left pupil, are suggestive of Horner syndrome. Horner syndrome is a condition that affects the sympathetic nerves to the eye and is characterized by miosis (constriction of the pupil), ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating). In this case, the patient does not have ptosis or anhidrosis, but the pupil findings are consistent with Horner syndrome.

Pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine, a sympathomimetic agent, can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In Horner syndrome, the affected pupil will dilate after administration of apraclonidine due to denervation supersensitivity.

The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation. Aneurysmal compression of the third cranial nerve or a brainstem stroke would typically present with other neurologic symptoms, which this patient does not have. A detailed review of medications could be useful if the patient was taking any medications known to cause anisocoria, but there is no indication of this in the case description.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",D,"I would choose to perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome. 

Horner syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms including ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), miosis (constriction of the pupil), and anhidrosis (decreased sweating on the affected side of the face). In this case, the patient presents with anisocoria (unequal pupil size) that is more pronounced in bright lighting conditions, along with a poorly reactive left pupil. These findings are consistent with Horner syndrome.

Apraclonidine is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. In patients with Horner syndrome, apraclonidine causes dilation of the affected pupil due to the interruption of sympathetic innervation to the dilator muscle of the iris. If the patient's left pupil dilates after the administration of apraclonidine, it would confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome.

Ordering computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out a brainstem stroke may not be necessary at this point. The patient does not have any other neurological symptoms or signs that would suggest an aneurysm or stroke. Additionally, a detailed review of systemic and topical medications may be considered, but it is less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis in this case.

Regarding the need for a corresponding medical image, in this case, a medical image such as computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance imaging is not necessary to make a diagnosis. The clinical presentation and findings on examination are sufficient to suggest Horner syndrome. Therefore, the answer is False.",D,"Based on the given information, the next appropriate step would be to perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome.

The patient presented with anisocoria, which is a condition where the pupils have unequal sizes. The left pupil is dilated and poorly reactive to light and near target. This could be indicative of Horner syndrome, a condition that affects the nerves that control the pupil and eyelid.

To confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome, pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine can be performed. Apraclonidine is a medication that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which can help to narrow the affected pupil. If the pupil responds to the medication, it would confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome.

Ordering computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve or ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out a brainstem stroke may be necessary in some cases, but based on the given information, it is not the most appropriate next step.

Performing a detailed review of systemic and topical medications may also be important to identify any potential causes of the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most immediate step needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome.",',"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome.

Horner syndrome is a condition that results from damage to the sympathetic nervous system, specifically the superior cervical ganglion. It is characterized by unilateral ptosis, anhidrosis (decreased sweating), and ipsilateral dilated pupil. The patient's symptoms of a dilated left pupil and anisocoria (unequal pupil size) in bright lighting conditions, along with her history of hypertension and palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis, suggest the possibility of Horner syndrome.

Apraclonidine is a medication that is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. It works by stimulating the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which are found in the sympathetic nervous system. In patients with Horner syndrome, the administration of apraclonidine will cause the pupil to constrict, which can help confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* Perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome.

Justification:

* Computed tomography angiography of the head may be necessary to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
* Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain may also be necessary to rule out a brainstem stroke, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
* A detailed review of systemic and topical medications may be necessary to identify any medications that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Medical image justification:

* True. A photograph of the patient's pupils in different lighting conditions (e.g., bright light, dim light) would be helpful in documenting the anisocoria and assessing the response to apraclonidine.",jama

A soft S1 was present on cardiac examination, and crackles were auscultated in basilar lung fields bilaterally. Three sets of blood cultures from different sites were obtained.

The patient's presentation of fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness, along with the physical examination findings of a soft S1 and crackles in the basilar lung fields, suggest a possible infection. The fact that blood cultures were taken from three different sites also points towards a suspicion of sepsis. The consultation of infectious disease physicians and the transfer to the intensive care unit further support this. In such a case, the immediate next step would be to start broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover a wide range of possible pathogens while waiting for the blood culture results to guide more specific therapy.

The other options are less likely. Diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms would be more appropriate for a patient with heart failure, but this patient's presentation is more consistent with infection. Emergency surgery for aortic valve repair and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump are invasive procedures that would not be the first line of treatment without more specific indications.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image. The clinical presentation and physical examination findings provide enough information to make a decision. However, the image could potentially provide additional useful information, such as evidence of endocarditis or other cardiac abnormalities. Therefore, the answer is <True>.",D,"Based on the given information, the patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension presenting with fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness. On examination, he has a soft S1 on cardiac examination and crackles in the basilar lung fields bilaterally. The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure and tachycardia.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe the patient. This is because the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of poor dentition suggest the possibility of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures have been obtained, and starting antibiotics promptly is crucial in managing this condition.

The other options listed are not the most appropriate next steps based on the given information. Ordering diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms may be considered later in the management of the patient, but the priority at this point is to start antibiotics. Emergency surgery for aortic valve repair and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump are not indicated based on the information provided.

Justification for the need for a medical image: False. The question does not require the corresponding medical image for the answer.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe the patient closely. The patient presents with symptoms of fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness, which could be indicative of an infection. The presence of crackles in the basilar lung fields bilaterally also suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Therefore, it is important to start antibiotics to treat any potential infection. 

Furthermore, the patient has a history of hypertension and a soft S1 was present on cardiac examination, which could indicate the presence of aortic stenosis. However, without further diagnostic tests, it is not clear whether the patient requires emergency surgery for aortic valve repair or placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Therefore, it is important to observe the patient closely and obtain further diagnostic tests before making any surgical interventions. 

Regarding the question of whether the corresponding medical image is needed, the answer is True. The medical image provided in the question is a transesophageal echocardiogram, which is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the heart's structure and function. This test would be helpful in determining the severity of the patient's condition and guiding the appropriate treatment plan.",D,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe. The patient's symptoms of fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness, along with the physical examination findings of diaphoresis, poor dentition, and crackles in the lung fields, suggest that the patient has sepsis. The presence of a soft S1 on cardiac examination and the need for cardiology, cardiac surgery, and infectious disease consultations suggest that the patient may have a cardiac condition that is contributing to the sepsis.

Starting broad-spectrum antibiotics would be appropriate to treat the sepsis, and close observation would be necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment and watch for any signs of cardiac decompensation.

Ordering diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms may be appropriate later on in the patient's management, but it is not the most urgent step at this time. Emergency surgery for aortic valve repair may be necessary if the patient's condition deteriorates, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time.

Core needle biopsy of the lesion', 'C. Simple excision of the lesion', 'D. Repeat imaging in 6 months']",B,B,"The correct answer is: Core needle biopsy of the lesion.

The reason for this choice is that the patient has a large, immobile, painless mass in her right gluteal area. Although the CT scan has revealed it to be a lipomatous tumor, it is still necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy. A core needle biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide a sufficient tissue sample for histopathological examination. This will help in determining the exact nature of the tumor and guide further management.

An incisional biopsy could also provide a tissue sample, but it is more invasive than a core needle biopsy. Simple excision of the lesion without prior biopsy could potentially lead to inadequate treatment if the mass turns out to be malignant. Repeat imaging in 6 months would not be appropriate given the current size of the tumor and the need for a definitive diagnosis.

The question does not necessarily need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the patient's symptoms and the CT scan results are sufficient to make a decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be an incisional biopsy of the lesion. An incisional biopsy involves taking a small sample of the mass for further examination under a microscope. This will help determine the nature of the mass and whether it is benign or malignant.

The reason for choosing an incisional biopsy is that the patient has an enlarging, immobile, painless mass in the right gluteal area. While the mass appears to be lipomatous (composed of fat), it is important to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any potential malignancy. An incisional biopsy will provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

Repeat imaging in 6 months may be considered if the initial biopsy results are inconclusive or if there is a high suspicion of a benign lipomatous tumor based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. However, given the size and characteristics of the mass, obtaining a tissue sample through biopsy is the most appropriate next step.

Regarding the need for a medical image, the question already provides a description of the CT findings, making it unnecessary to include the corresponding medical image. False.",B,"Core needle biopsy of the lesion

The best next step in this case would be to perform a core needle biopsy of the lesion. This is because a biopsy is necessary to determine the nature of the mass, and a core needle biopsy is a minimally invasive way to obtain a tissue sample. An incisional biopsy would be more invasive and may not be necessary at this stage. Simple excision of the lesion would be premature without first determining the nature of the mass.

Core needle biopsy of the lesion

The patient presents with a large, immobile, painless mass in her right gluteal area, with no other associated symptoms. The mass is palpable and nontender, and there are no neurovascular deficits. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. The CT scan reveals a heterogeneous lipomatous tumor involving the right gluteal musculature.

Given these findings, it is likely that the mass is a benign lipoma, which is a common type of soft tissue tumor. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible diagnoses, such as a malignant soft tissue sarcoma, a biopsy is necessary.

Core needle biopsy is the preferred method of biopsy in this case because it allows for a larger sample of tissue to be obtained compared to incisional biopsy, which may not provide a representative sample of the entire tumor. Additionally, core needle biopsy is less invasive than simple excision, which may not be necessary if the diagnosis is benign.

Repeat imaging in 6 months may be appropriate if the patient had a history of previous malignancy or if there were concerns about the stability of the lesion, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the current information.

Approximately 3 weeks after symptom onset, she presented to the emergency department again with persistent fever, worsening arthralgia, back pain, and progressive purpuric and pustular rash. Her vital signs were unremarkable. White blood cell count was 12 100/μL (reference range, 4000/μL-10 000/μL), with 84% neutrophils.

The patient's symptoms and the fact that she works on a farm suggest a zoonotic infection, which is an infection transmitted to humans from animals. The rash spreading to her palms and soles, fever, vomiting, and joint pain are all symptoms that could be associated with a zoonotic disease. The elevated white blood cell count indicates an ongoing infection. The Gram stain of blood culture might also provide clues about the type of bacteria causing the infection. Therefore, inquiring about rodent and other animal exposures could provide crucial information about potential sources of infection.

Testing for Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, could be considered given the patient's location in Connecticut, a region where Lyme disease is endemic. However, the patient's symptoms do not align perfectly with Lyme disease, which typically presents with a characteristic ""bull's eye"" rash, not a maculopapular rash that progresses to pustules.

Obtaining joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures could also be considered, given the patient's severe joint pain. However, this would not necessarily provide information about the source of the infection.

Testing vesicular fluid for enterovirus is less likely to be helpful, as enteroviruses typically cause symptoms of the common cold, not the severe symptoms described here.

The medical image is not necessary to answer this question, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to test for Borrelia burgdorferi. The patient's history of working on a farm in Connecticut, along with the presence of fever, rash, and joint pain, raises suspicion for Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Lyme disease is commonly transmitted through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Testing for Borrelia burgdorferi, such as through serologic testing, can help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

In this case, there is no mention of rodent or other animal exposures, so inquiring about them may not be the most relevant next step. Obtaining joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures could be considered if there is a high suspicion for a bacterial joint infection, but given the patient's history and presentation, Lyme disease is a more likely diagnosis. Testing vesicular fluid for enterovirus would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient's symptoms and clinical findings are not consistent with enterovirus infection.

The patient's symptoms of back pain, stiff neck, headache, and fevers, along with the right knee pain and swelling, suggest a possible systemic infection or inflammation. The patient's history of pseudogout and kidney transplant, along with his current medications, also make him more susceptible to infections. However, the negative blood and CSF cultures make an infectious cause less likely. 

The MRI of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow, but no clear source of the patient's symptoms. A CT scan could provide additional information about the patient's condition, particularly if there is a concern for a deeper or more localized infection or inflammation that was not apparent on the MRI.

The other options are less appropriate. Continuing intravenous antibiotics would be reasonable if there was a clear infectious cause, but the negative cultures make this less likely. Gabapentin is typically used for neuropathic pain, which does not seem to be the primary issue here.

The patient's symptoms of back pain, stiff neck, headache, and fever, along with the physical examination findings of nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig sign, suggest a possible diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis. The laboratory workup, including the white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, support this possibility. The MRI of the spine showing cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow also suggests a possible inflammatory process.

However, the patient's history of pseudogout and kidney transplant, as well as the negative blood and CSF cultures, suggest that the cause of the symptoms may not be solely due to an infectious process.

The patient's history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, along with his symptoms of fatigue and conjunctival pallor, suggest that he may be suffering from a nutritional deficiency. RYGB surgery can lead to malabsorption of various nutrients, including iron, copper, and zinc, which are essential for the production of blood cells. This could explain his new-onset pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets). Therefore, checking his serum trace element levels would be a logical next step in his evaluation.

The other options are less likely to be helpful at this stage. Periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and supportive transfusions may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens, but they would not address the underlying cause of his pancytopenia. An endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract might be indicated if there were symptoms or signs suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding or malignancy, but this is not the case here. Starting an erythropoiesis stimulating agent would not be appropriate without first identifying and addressing the cause of the patient's pancytopenia.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. This is because the patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, which can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, including iron, leading to pancytopenia. Endoscopy would help evaluate for any gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes of malabsorption.

Checking serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc, may be considered as part of the workup for pancytopenia, but given the patient's history of gastric bypass surgery, endoscopy would provide more direct information.

Obtaining periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treating with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated may be necessary in the short term to manage the pancytopenia, but it does not address the underlying cause.

Starting erythropoiesis stimulating agent may be considered in certain cases of anemia, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient with pancytopenia.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",A,"Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc. 

The patient has presented with pancytopenia, which is a condition characterized by a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. One possible cause of pancytopenia is a deficiency in trace elements such as iron, copper, and zinc. Therefore, it would be appropriate to check the patient's serum levels of these trace elements to determine if a deficiency is present. If a deficiency is found, supplementation with the appropriate trace element may be necessary to treat the pancytopenia.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to obtain periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treat with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated.

The patient's history of pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all blood cell counts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, suggests that there may be an underlying issue with bone marrow production or destruction of blood cells. The patient's history of viral myocarditis and use of medications such as lisinopril and carvedilol, which can cause bone marrow suppression, support this possibility.

The patient's recent fatigue and conjunctival pallor also suggest that there may be anemia, which is a decrease in red blood cells. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient's complete blood cell counts regularly and provide supportive transfusions as needed to address any anemia or blood cell deficiencies.

While checking serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc, may be useful in some cases of pancytopenia, it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's history and symptoms. Similarly, performing endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest any obvious gastrointestinal bleeding or other issues that would require endoscopy.

Starting erythropoiesis stimulating agent may also not be appropriate at this time, as the patient's anemia is not severe enough to require such treatment, and it may not address the underlying cause of the pancytopenia.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to obtain periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treat with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated, while continuing to monitor the patient's symptoms and medications to determine if further testing or interventions are needed.

She was initially diagnosed as having preterm labor and was given antibiotics, steroids, an epidural catheter for pain management, and intravenous fentanyl as needed. She delivered a healthy baby without complications, but her severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting persisted. Thirty-six hours after her initial presentation, she still had rebound tenderness in the left side of the abdomen. She was afebrile, blood pressure was 104/77 mm Hg, and heart rate was 152/min. White blood cell count was 10.7 ×109/L; anion gap, 13 mEq/L; and lactate dehydrogenase level, 131.7 U/L (2.2 μkat/L).

The patient's symptoms and the CT scan results suggest a mesenteric vascular compromise, which is a serious condition that can lead to bowel ischemia and necrosis if not treated promptly. The patient's hematemesis (vomiting blood) further indicates a severe and potentially life-threatening condition. An exploratory laparotomy would allow for direct visualization and potential correction of the problem.

Esophagogastrojejunoscopy is typically used for upper GI tract issues and wouldn't be as useful in this case. Highly selective mesenteric angiography could potentially identify the exact location of the vascular compromise, but it wouldn't allow for immediate intervention. Diagnostic laparoscopy could be used to visualize the problem, but it may not allow for the same level of intervention as a laparotomy, especially in a potentially unstable patient.

Therefore, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most appropriate next step would be highly selective mesenteric angiography.

The patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rebound tenderness, and mesenteric vascular compromise on CT scan suggests the possibility of mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric ischemia is a serious condition that occurs when there is inadequate blood flow to the intestines, leading to tissue damage and potentially life-threatening complications.

Highly selective mesenteric angiography is a diagnostic procedure that can help confirm the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia by visualizing the blood vessels supplying the intestines. It can identify any blockages or narrowing in the mesenteric arteries, which may require intervention such as angioplasty or surgical revascularization.

Esophagogastrojejunoscopy (EGJ) is not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are suggestive of mesenteric ischemia rather than a gastrointestinal bleed.

Exploratory laparotomy and diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered if there is a high suspicion of mesenteric ischemia and the patient's condition deteriorates or if the angiography findings are inconclusive. However, angiography is less invasive and can provide valuable information before considering surgical intervention.

Justification: Highly selective mesenteric angiography is the most appropriate next step because it can confirm the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia and guide further management decisions. It is a less invasive procedure compared to exploratory laparotomy or diagnostic laparoscopy, allowing for a more targeted approach to treatment.

The question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,The correct answer is: Exploratory laparotomy,B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the CT scan, the most appropriate next step would be exploratory laparotomy.

Exploratory laparotomy would allow for visualization of the abdominal cavity and identification of any potential issues, such as a bowel obstruction or ischemia, and would also allow for any necessary interventions to be performed.

Esophagogastrojejunoscopy would not be appropriate in this case, as it is a procedure used to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract and would not allow for visualization of the lower abdomen or pelvis, where the patient's symptoms are located.

Highly selective mesenteric angiography may be considered in some cases of suspected mesenteric vascular compromise, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as it would not allow for visualization of the abdominal cavity and may not provide sufficient information to guide treatment.

Diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered in some cases of suspected bowel obstruction or ischemia, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as it would not allow for visualization of the entire abdominal cavity and may not provide sufficient information to guide treatment.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Exploratory laparotomy.

The patient, a construction demolition worker, was otherwise healthy and took no medications. He had 1 lifetime female sexual partner with whom he used barrier contraception. Physical examination revealed an asymmetric cluster of lesions on the right flank measuring 14 × 12 cm at the widest margins (Figure 1). The cluster contained verrucous papules and plaques in the center and vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid in the periphery. Crust was partially covering some of the lesions. The surrounding skin was erythematous without warmth or induration.

The patient's symptoms suggest a chronic skin condition that has not responded to previous antibiotic treatment. The description of the lesions - verrucous papules and plaques, vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid, and crust partially covering some of the lesions - is not specific to a single diagnosis. Therefore, a biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to determine the exact nature of the skin condition. 

Prescribing oral valacyclovir would be appropriate if there was a strong suspicion of a herpes infection, but the patient's sexual history and the chronic nature of the lesions do not strongly support this. Topical cantharadin is used for the treatment of warts, but again, the description of the lesions does not definitively point to this diagnosis. Recommending a gluten-free diet would be appropriate if there was suspicion of dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin manifestation of celiac disease, but the patient does not have other symptoms suggestive of this condition.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description of the lesions and the patient's history provide sufficient information to make a decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to biopsy the lesions. The patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of a chronic and recurrent skin condition. Biopsy would help in establishing a definitive diagnosis by examining the tissue under a microscope, which can aid in determining the underlying cause of the lesions.

Prescribing oral valacyclovir, a medication used to treat viral infections such as herpes, may not be the most appropriate choice in this case. Although the patient's lesions contain vesicles filled with fluid, there is no mention of any typical features of a viral infection, such as pain, burning, or tingling sensation. Additionally, the lesions have been present for 8 years, which is not consistent with an acute viral infection.

Prescribing topical cantharadin, a medication derived from blister beetles, is not indicated in this case. Cantharadin is typically used for the treatment of warts and molluscum contagiosum, which do not seem to be the primary concern based on the provided information.

Recommending a gluten-free diet is not warranted in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest any association with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Therefore, there is no indication to recommend a gluten-free diet.

Justification for the chosen answer: Biopsy of the lesions would provide valuable information to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. It would help differentiate between various possible causes such as infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic etiologies.

Justification for not needing a medical image: Based on the description provided, a medical image is not necessary to answer the question. The information provided is sufficient to make a decision regarding the next step in management.",A,"Biopsy the lesions

The correct answer is to biopsy the lesions. This is because the patient has a history of painful and pruritic skin lesions on his right flank that have alternately increased and decreased over the years. Additionally, the lesions occasionally rupture and leak clear fluid, which is a concerning symptom. The physical examination reveals an asymmetric cluster of lesions on the right flank containing verrucous papules and plaques in the center and vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid in the periphery. Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is important to perform a biopsy to determine the underlying cause of the lesions. Prescribing oral valacyclovir or topical cantharadin without a definitive diagnosis would be premature and may not be effective in treating the condition. Similarly, recommending a gluten-free diet would not be appropriate as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has celiac disease or a gluten intolerance.",A,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to biopsy the lesions. This is because the patient has a history of painful and pruritic skin lesions that have been present for 8 years, and have been increasing and decreasing in number and severity over time. The lesions have also ruptured and leaked clear fluid, which suggests that they may be a type of skin cancer. The patient's occupation as a construction demolition worker also increases the likelihood of skin cancer, as they are exposed to various carcinogens and UV radiation.

A biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesions, which would guide further management and treatment. It would also help to rule out other potential causes of the lesions, such as a skin infection or autoimmune disorder.

Therefore, the answer is (a) Biopsy the lesions.

Justification:

The patient's history of painful and pruritic skin lesions, along with the physical examination findings of verrucous papules and plaques, vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid, and crusting, are all consistent with a diagnosis of skin cancer. The patient's occupation and history of a ""skin infection"" on his right flank also support this diagnosis. A biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management and treatment.

The infant was born to a 31-year-old mother by normal vaginal delivery. The mother had a benign prenatal course during pregnancy. Since the rash developed, the infant had been fussy with increasing restlessness at night. The parents denied any personal or family history of rash. On further questioning, the parents reported that the infant had had contact with a babysitter who reported pruritus, especially at night. The sitter had provided domestic care for the infant since birth until leaving that position 3 weeks earlier.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Administer intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics', 'B. Start a topical steroid', 'C. Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites', 'D.

The infant's symptoms, including a papulopustulovesicular rash and increased fussiness and restlessness at night, along with the babysitter's reported pruritus (itching), especially at night, are suggestive of scabies. Scabies is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs, causing intense itching and a pimple-like rash. 

Skin scraping and subsequent microscopic examination is a common diagnostic method for scabies. It involves scraping the skin at the end of a burrow and examining the material under a microscope to look for mites, eggs, or mite fecal matter. 

Broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be appropriate as scabies is caused by mites, not bacteria. Topical steroids might alleviate some symptoms but would not treat the underlying infestation. Doing nothing and reassuring the parents would not be appropriate given the infant's symptoms and the potential for the infestation to spread to other family members.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites. 

This patient's presentation is consistent with scabies, which is a parasitic infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The characteristic rash, worsening over time, along with the history of contact with a babysitter who had pruritus, especially at night, raises suspicion for scabies. Skin scraping is the gold standard for diagnosing scabies as it allows for visualization of the mite, eggs, or fecal matter under a microscope.

Administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be indicated in this case as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. Starting a topical steroid would not be appropriate as it may worsen the scabies infestation. Doing nothing and reassuring the parents would not address the underlying cause of the rash and the infant's symptoms.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate answer would be to perform a skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites. The symptoms described suggest the possibility of scabies, which is caused by a mite that burrows into the skin. A skin scraping can confirm the diagnosis by identifying the presence of the mite or its eggs. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate treatment can be initiated, which may include topical medication or prescription creams. Administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be necessary for this condition, as it is not caused by a bacterial infection. Starting a topical steroid would also not be appropriate, as it would not address the underlying cause of the rash. Doing nothing and reassuring the parents would not be appropriate, as the condition can be uncomfortable and potentially contagious.",C,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites.

Skin scraping would help to confirm the diagnosis and identify any bacterial or viral organisms that may be causing the rash.

Administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be appropriate at this stage, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection, and the rash does not appear to be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Starting a topical steroid would also not be appropriate, as steroids are not effective against bacterial or viral infections, and may even worsen the condition.

Five years ago he had a black ink tattoo placed on his left arm, and 3 years ago a second tattoo was placed on his right arm. Two years after the right arm tattoo was placed, he noticed tattoo elevation on the left arm and onset of decreased vision. He had recurrent episodes of ocular redness and blurred vision, coincident with inflammation of the skin surrounding both tattoos. Two months before presentation, bilateral peripheral iridotomies (iris laser procedures) were performed because of inflammation-induced adhesions between the iris and the lens (Figure, panel A).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Initiate topical steroid eyedrop therapy', 'B. Recommend removal of tattoos', 'C. Refer immediately to rheumatology', 'D.

The patient's symptoms suggest a condition known as uveitis, which is inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. This condition can cause redness, pain, light sensitivity, blurred vision, and dark, floating spots in the field of vision. Uveitis can be associated with autoimmune disorders, but it can also be triggered by trauma or exposure to toxins. In this case, the patient's tattoos and the associated inflammation could be the trigger.

Topical steroid eyedrop therapy is a common treatment for uveitis. Steroids can reduce inflammation and alleviate the patient's symptoms. The other options are less appropriate. Removal of tattoos might not alleviate the inflammation and could potentially cause more trauma. Referral to rheumatology would be more appropriate if there were signs of an underlying autoimmune disorder, which is not evident in this case. Surgical implantation of a glaucoma drainage device would be a more invasive procedure and would typically be considered if other treatments were ineffective.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the patient's symptoms and history is sufficient to make a diagnosis and recommend a course of treatment. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient immediately to rheumatology. The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, ocular redness, and inflammation of the skin surrounding the tattoos suggest an inflammatory process that may be associated with an underlying systemic condition. The fact that the symptoms started after the placement of the tattoos and are affecting both eyes indicates a systemic involvement rather than a localized reaction. Rheumatology consultation would be necessary to evaluate for any potential autoimmune or inflammatory disorders that may be causing the ocular and dermatologic manifestations.

The other options, such as initiating topical steroid eyedrop therapy or performing surgical implantation of a glaucoma drainage device, may be considered later in the management of the patient depending on the findings from the rheumatology evaluation. However, the initial step should be to investigate and address the underlying systemic cause.

In this case, the question does not require the corresponding medical image.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient to rheumatology. This is because the patient's symptoms suggest a possible autoimmune or inflammatory condition, which could be related to the tattoos or other underlying factors. A rheumatologist would be best suited to evaluate the patient's symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment options. While topical steroid eyedrops may help manage the symptoms, they are not a long-term solution and do not address the underlying cause of the condition. Removal of the tattoos may also be considered, but this would not necessarily address the underlying condition and could potentially worsen the symptoms. Surgical implantation of a glaucoma drainage device would not be appropriate as the patient's symptoms do not suggest glaucoma.",C,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to refer the patient immediately to rheumatology.

The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, ocular redness, and inflammation of the skin surrounding the tattoos suggest a possible autoimmune disorder, such as uveitis or scleritis. The fact that the patient has had two tattoos in the past five years and has experienced tattoo elevation on the left arm and onset of decreased vision after the second tattoo was placed, suggests that the tattoos may be triggering an immune response.

Rheumatology is the specialty that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and management of autoimmune disorders, and a rheumatologist would be best equipped to evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the appropriate course of action.

Topical steroid eyedrop therapy may provide some relief for the patient's ocular symptoms, but it would not address the underlying autoimmune disorder. Removal of the tattoos may be considered, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in the patient's care. Surgical implantation of a glaucoma drainage device would not be appropriate for the patient's condition.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Refer immediately to rheumatology.

The patient's symptoms, along with the laboratory and imaging findings, suggest a malignancy. The elevated AFP level and the presence of multiple hypoattenuating masses in the liver could suggest hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the presence of a pancreatic tail mass and the absence of typical signs of chronic liver disease make a pancreatic malignancy with liver metastases more likely. 

Before starting any treatment, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis. An endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration of the pancreatic mass would allow for cytological examination and definitive diagnosis. 

FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and sorafenib are treatment options for pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, but should only be initiated after a definitive diagnosis. An 18F-FDG PET scan could provide additional information about the metabolic activity and potential spread of the disease, but it is not typically the first step in the diagnostic process.

To confirm the diagnosis and obtain tissue for further analysis, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is recommended. EUS allows for detailed imaging of the pancreas and adjacent structures, and FNA can provide a tissue sample for histopathological examination.

The other options listed are not the most appropriate next steps in this case:

1. Beginning FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy is premature without a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

2. Sorafenib is a targeted therapy used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and is not indicated in this patient with suspected pancreatic cancer.

3. Performing a fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be useful for staging and assessing the extent of disease in pancreatic cancer, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The initial step should be obtaining tissue for diagnosis.

The question does not require the corresponding medical image for answering.",D,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration. This is because the CT scan revealed a pancreatic tail mass that was not seen on the previous single-phase CT scan.

The elevated alkaline phosphatase level and normal total bilirubin level suggest that the patient has a liver function abnormality, which is consistent with the presence of liver metastases. The elevated AFP level is also consistent with a PNET diagnosis, as AFP is a marker for yolk sac tumors, which are a type of PNET. The patient's symptoms of malaise and weight loss are also consistent with a PNET diagnosis.

Given these findings, the best next step would be to perform a fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

The patient's symptoms of fever, anorexia, rash, throat pain, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, and a maculopapular rash are suggestive of an acute viral infection. These symptoms can be seen in a variety of conditions, including HIV seroconversion illness. Given the patient's age and the absence of other risk factors for immunosuppression, HIV should be considered in the differential diagnosis. 

Administering an intravenous steroid would not be the first step without a clear diagnosis. A liver biopsy is invasive and not indicated based on the symptoms presented.

Given the patient's lack of response to doxycycline, ofloxacin, and rifampin, it is likely that she has multibacillary leprosy and would benefit from a 12-month course of dapsone and rifampin.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. So, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve. This is because the patient's presentation with a hyperpigmented macule, hypoesthesia, and perineural granulomas suggests a possible infectious etiology, such as leprosy. A biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Prescribing a 6-month course of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (choice C) is the standard treatment regimen for tuberculosis, but it may not be effective for other infectious causes.

Prescribing a 12-month course of dapsone combined with rifampin (choice D) is the standard treatment for leprosy, but it would be premature to start treatment without confirming the diagnosis through a biopsy.

No further treatment is indicated (choice A) is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings suggest an underlying pathology that requires further investigation and treatment.

Justification for the need for a medical image: A medical image, such as a photograph or histopathological image of the lesion, would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and guiding further management.",D,"Prescribe a 12-month course of dapsone combined with rifampin

The patient's symptoms and history suggest the possibility of leprosy. Although a biopsy was performed, it did not yield any definitive results. Given the patient's epidemiological background and clinical presentation, it is reasonable to start treatment for leprosy with a combination of dapsone and rifampin. This treatment is recommended by the World Health Organization as a standard regimen for leprosy.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve. This is because the patient has a history of hypoesthesia over the lesion, which suggests that there may be nerve damage or involvement. The biopsy results from Bangladesh showed multiple perineural granulomas with inflammatory cells, which suggests that there may be an underlying infection or inflammatory condition affecting the nerve.

Furthermore, the patient did not respond to the antibiotics prescribed, which suggests that the infection may be resistant to those particular antibiotics. A diagnostic biopsy would allow for a more detailed examination of the tissue and nerve damage, and would help to guide further treatment decisions.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve.

Justification:
The question does not explicitly state that a medical image is needed, but it does mention a hyperpigmented macule on the medial side of the patient's right palm. In order to fully assess the lesion and determine the extent of nerve damage, a medical image such as a photograph or MRI scan of the affected area would be helpful.

The patient's history of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and recent ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization could potentially increase her risk for endocarditis, a serious infection of the heart's inner lining. Acute abdominal pain could be a symptom of this condition if emboli have dislodged and caused infarction in abdominal organs. 

The other options are less likely. ""Observe only"" is not appropriate given the acute nature of her symptoms. ""Refer the patient to oncology for chemotherapy"" is not indicated as there is no mention of cancer. ""Start treatment with sirolimus"" is not appropriate as this medication is typically used for organ transplant patients to prevent rejection, and there is no mention of a transplant in the patient's history.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image. An echocardiogram would be the appropriate diagnostic tool in this case, but the question can be answered based on the patient's history and symptoms alone. So, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis. The patient's history of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension puts her at risk for developing endocarditis, especially if she has recently undergone ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization. Acute abdominal pain could be a symptom of endocarditis, and echocardiography can help evaluate the condition of the heart valves and detect any signs of infection.

The other options, such as observing only, referring the patient to oncology for chemotherapy, or starting treatment with sirolimus, are not indicated based on the given information. Observing only may not be appropriate given the potential seriousness of the patient's symptoms. Referring to oncology for chemotherapy is not relevant as there is no mention of cancer in the patient's history.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis

The patient has a history of multiple surgeries, including a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Given her recent surgical history and acute abdominal pain, it is important to rule out any potential complications, such as right-sided endocarditis. Cardiac echocardiography is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that can help identify any issues with the heart valves or detect an infection.

Justification for the question including a medical image: False. The question does not require a medical image to be answered appropriately.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis.

The patient's history of bariatric gastric bypass surgery, hysterectomy, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy suggest that she has a history of cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Additionally, her recent ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization may have increased her risk of developing blood clots.

Right-sided endocarditis, also known as infective endocarditis, is a potentially life-threatening infection of the inner lining of the heart. It can occur when bacteria enter the bloodstream and colonize the heart tissues. The patient's symptoms of acute abdominal pain and history of recent surgery and medical procedures suggest that she may be at risk for developing this condition.

Performing a cardiac echocardiography would allow doctors to visualize the heart and its valves, and check for any signs of infection or inflammation. This test would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation and management.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis.

Justification for the answer:

The patient's history of recent surgery, medical procedures, and symptoms of acute abdominal pain suggest that she may be at risk for developing right-sided endocarditis.

The patient's symptoms of severe weakness, difficulty ambulating, numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, and memory impairment are suggestive of a neurological condition. The additional symptoms of nausea, abdominal bloating, and anorexia further suggest a systemic issue. These symptoms can be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause neurological symptoms due to its role in myelin synthesis and hematopoiesis. The MMA level can also be elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency, as B12 is a cofactor for the conversion of MMA to succinyl-CoA.

An MRI of the brain, while useful in diagnosing many neurological conditions, may not be immediately necessary given the patient's specific symptoms and their progression. The RPR test is used to diagnose syphilis, which can cause neurological symptoms, but this patient's symptoms and history do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. An electromyogram could be useful in diagnosing neuromuscular conditions, but again, the patient's symptoms and history suggest a systemic issue like vitamin B12 deficiency.

Therefore, checking a serum vitamin B12 level, MMA level, or both would be the most appropriate next step in this patient's care.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms of severe weakness, difficulty ambulating, numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, progressive memory impairment, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia, the most appropriate next step would be to check a serum vitamin B12 level and methylmalonic acid (MMA) level.

These symptoms are suggestive of a possible vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and memory impairment. Checking the serum vitamin B12 level will help determine if the patient has a deficiency, while measuring MMA levels can provide further confirmation.

An MRI of the brain may be considered if there are specific neurological findings or if the vitamin B12 levels are normal, but it is not the initial step in this case.

A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is used to screen for syphilis, which does not seem to be indicated based on the patient's symptoms.

Performing an electromyogram (EMG) may be considered if there is suspicion of a peripheral neuropathy, but given the patient's symptoms and the possibility of a vitamin B12 deficiency, checking the serum vitamin B12 level and MMA level would be a more appropriate initial step.

Justification for the need for a medical image: False. At this point, there is no indication for an MRI of the brain based on the patient's symptoms.",A,"Check a serum vitamin B12 level, methylmalonic acid (MMA) level, or both

The symptoms described, such as weakness, difficulty ambulating, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet, are indicative of possible vitamin B12 deficiency. Additionally, the presence of memory impairment and abdominal symptoms could also be related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, checking serum vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels would be the most appropriate next step to help diagnose the condition. MMA is a specific marker of B12 deficiency, and both tests can help determine if the symptoms are due to a deficiency in vitamin B12.",A,"Based on the symptoms described, the most appropriate next step would be to check a serum vitamin B12 level, methylmalonic acid (MMA) level, or both.

The patient's symptoms of severe weakness, difficulty ambulating independently, numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, and progressive memory impairment suggest a possible vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the production of myelin, the fatty insulating substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can cause demyelination of nerve fibers, leading to symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and tingling. Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a metabolite that is produced when vitamin B12 is deficient, so measuring MMA levels can also help diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency.

Therefore, checking a serum vitamin B12 level, methylmalonic acid (MMA) level, or both would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing this patient's symptoms.

Justification for not choosing the other options:

Option B, obtaining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, may be necessary later on in the diagnostic workup, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While MRI can help identify structural abnormalities in the brain, it may not be able to diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency.

Option C, ordering a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history. RPR is a test used to diagnose syphilis, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

Option D, performing an electromyogram, may be necessary later on in the diagnostic workup, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

The patient's symptoms of persistent fever, lymphadenopathy, and edema suggest a systemic inflammatory or infectious process. The absence of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or urinary symptoms makes localized infection less likely. The lack of recent travel or ill contacts makes certain infectious diseases less likely. 

Positron emission tomography (PET) can help identify areas of increased metabolic activity, which can be indicative of inflammation or malignancy. This can help guide further diagnostic steps, such as biopsy of a specific area.

Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication, but there's no specific indication of a viral infection in this case. High-dose glucocorticoids could potentially worsen an underlying infection by suppressing the immune system. A splenic biopsy could be considered, but it's an invasive procedure and should be guided by imaging findings.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image. The decision to perform PET is based on the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, not on any specific imaging findings. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a splenic biopsy.

The patient's presentation of fever, lower limb and periorbital swelling, bilateral nontender cervical lymphadenopathy, and pedal edema suggests a systemic illness. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and pedal edema may indicate lymphatic involvement. In this case, a splenic biopsy would be helpful in evaluating for possible lymphoproliferative disorders or other systemic diseases.

Starting ganciclovir would not be appropriate as there is no indication of viral infection mentioned in the patient's history or physical examination findings.

Starting high-dose glucocorticoids would not be the initial step without a clear indication. Glucocorticoids may be considered in certain autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, but further evaluation is needed before initiating such treatment.

Performing positron emission tomography (PET) may be useful in certain cases to evaluate for malignancies or infections. However, in this scenario, there is no specific indication for PET mentioned, and a splenic biopsy would provide more direct information.

The patient's symptoms of unremitting fever, lower limb and periorbital swelling, and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy suggest a possible diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder, such as lymphoma. The absence of cough, dyspnea, or bowel or urinary symptoms suggests that the disease is unlikely to be a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. The patient's age and ethnicity also increase the likelihood of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

A splenic biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis, as it would allow for a histopathological examination of the spleen and would provide valuable information for further management.

Starting ganciclovir or high-dose glucocorticoids without a definitive diagnosis would be inappropriate, as they are used to treat specific conditions (herpes zoster and immune-mediated disorders, respectively) that are not supported by the patient's symptoms and medical history.

An image-guided core biopsy of the mediastinal mass would provide tissue for histopathological examination, which is necessary for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning. 

The other options are less appropriate. An excisional biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node could be considered, but it is more invasive and may not be necessary if the mediastinal mass is accessible. Thoracentesis with cytologic analysis of pleural fluid could be useful if there is pleural effusion, but the case does not mention this. Urgent radiation therapy for superior vena cava syndrome is not indicated because the patient does not have symptoms of this condition, such as facial swelling or shortness of breath.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",B,The correct answer is: Image-guided core biopsy of the mediastinal mass,B,"Based on the symptoms and history provided, the most appropriate next step would be:

Image-guided core biopsy of the mediastinal mass

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss, along with a 6-month history of these symptoms, suggest a possible diagnosis of a mediastinal mass or lesion. The fact that the patient was previously healthy and had no known medical conditions or risk factors for lung disease, and the lack of improvement after treatment for presumed pneumonia, also support the need for further diagnostic evaluation.

An image-guided core biopsy of the mediastinal mass would allow for a tissue diagnosis, which would help guide further management and treatment.

Recent travel included visits to Uganda, Afghanistan, Albania, and Croatia and frequent hiking and camping trips. She received initial therapy with inhaled albuterol and oral azithromycin, but symptoms did not improve. A chest radiograph was unremarkable. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a mediastinal and endobronchial broncholith compromising the left main-stem bronchus lumen (Figure 1). Extensive testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungal and bacterial infectious agents were within normal limits, with the exception of a borderline urine Histoplasma antigen level (<0.5 ng/dL).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A.

Perform diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement']",D,D,"The correct next step would be to ""Perform diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement"". 

The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest the presence of a broncholith, which is a calcified material in the bronchial tree. Broncholiths can cause symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and lithoptysis, as seen in this patient. The borderline urine Histoplasma antigen level suggests a possible exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum, a fungus that can cause lung infections and is endemic in certain parts of the United States, including Mississippi and Nebraska where the patient previously lived. However, the patient's symptoms did not improve with azithromycin, which is an antibiotic, suggesting that a bacterial infection is not the primary issue.

A diagnostic bronchoscopy can confirm the presence of a broncholith and endobronchial debridement can help alleviate the patient's symptoms by removing the broncholith. Antifungal therapy may not be necessary at this point as the patient's Histoplasma antigen level is only borderline and she does not have other signs of a systemic fungal infection. A thoracotomy and excisional biopsy would be more invasive and may not be necessary at this point. A PET-CT scan could provide additional information about the broncholith, but it would not directly address the patient's symptoms or the broncholith itself.

Therefore, the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and lithoptysis, along with the CT findings of a broncholith compromising the left main-stem bronchus lumen, suggest an obstructive lesion in the airway. To further evaluate and treat this condition, diagnostic bronchoscopy would be necessary to visualize the airway and obtain samples for biopsy or debridement of the broncholith.

Starting antifungal therapy would not be the first-line approach in this case, as there is only a borderline urine Histoplasma antigen level and extensive testing for infectious agents was within normal limits.

Performing thoracotomy and excisional biopsy would be a more invasive procedure and should be reserved for cases where less invasive measures, such as bronchoscopy, have been unsuccessful or inconclusive.

Ordering a PET-CT scan may provide additional information, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. Diagnostic bronchoscopy would be more direct and allow for visualization and intervention.

Justification: The patient's symptoms, CT findings, and the need for visualization and intervention in the airway suggest that diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement would be the most appropriate next step.

The question does not require the corresponding medical image.",P,"The correct answer is: Perform diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient is likely suffering from broncholithiasis, which is the presence of calcified or ossified material within the bronchial lumen. The most appropriate next step would be to perform a diagnostic bronchoscopy to visualize the broncholith and remove it via endobronchial debridement. This procedure involves using a flexible bronchoscope to access the affected area and remove the obstruction. Starting antifungal therapy or performing a thoracotomy and excisional biopsy would not be appropriate as there is no evidence of fungal infection or malignancy. Ordering a PET-CT scan may be useful in evaluating the extent of the broncholithiasis, but it would not be the first-line treatment.",D,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to perform diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement.

The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and lithoptysis (expectoration of calcific material) suggest a possible respiratory infection or obstruction. The chest radiograph was unremarkable, but the CT scan of the chest revealed a mediastinal and endobronchial broncholith compromising the left main-stem bronchus lumen, which supports the diagnosis of a respiratory obstruction.

The fact that the patient has a borderline urine Histoplasma antigen level (<0.5 ng/dL) suggests that she may have histoplasmosis, a fungal infection that can cause respiratory symptoms. However, the patient's extensive testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungal and bacterial infectious agents were within normal limits, which makes it less likely that the symptoms are caused by a fungal or bacterial infection.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to perform diagnostic bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement to remove the broncholith and determine the cause of the respiratory obstruction. This procedure will allow for a direct visualization of the airways and collection of samples for further analysis, which will help to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further treatment.

Starting antifungal therapy without further evaluation and diagnosis may not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms may not be caused by a fungal infection.

The patient's history of ovarian cancer and the presence of a new, nontender nodule adjacent to her stoma raises the suspicion of possible metastasis or recurrence of her cancer. A biopsy would provide the most definitive information about the nature of the nodule, including whether it is malignant or benign, and if malignant, the type of cancer cells present. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan.

The other options are less likely to be appropriate without more information. Swabbing and sending for cultures would be more appropriate if there was a suspicion of infection, but the nodule is described as nontender, which makes infection less likely. Consulting wound care for barrier protection and prescribing topical steroids would be more appropriate for issues related to skin irritation or inflammation, but again, the patient's history of cancer makes these less likely to be the primary issue.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image.

Swabbing and sending for cultures may be considered if there are signs of infection or if there is suspicion of an infectious process. However, in this case, the nodule is described as nontender, which suggests that infection may not be the primary concern.

Consulting wound care for barrier protection may be relevant if there are issues related to the colostomy site, such as skin irritation or breakdown. However, the nodule itself needs to be evaluated further before addressing any potential wound care needs.

Prescribing topical steroids may be considered if there is evidence of inflammation or dermatitis around the nodule. However, without further information, it is not clear if this is the most appropriate course of action.

A previous biopsy showed a pyogenic granuloma, and she had been treated with curettage and electrodessication. In the few months before presentation, she experienced partial nail loss and her nail had become painful with intermittent drainage. Her medical history was significant for streptococcal glomerulonephritis and 2 prior kidney transplants. Her medications included prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Physical examination of the left second fingernail showed a tender ulcerated nodule encompassing the nail bed with near-complete nail loss and purulent drainage (Figure 1, left). A nail biopsy was repeated by performing a 4-mm punch through the nail bed. The specimen was analyzed by histopathology with hematoxylin-eosin staining and once again showed a pyogenic granuloma–like response characterized by proliferating blood vessels in a background of fibrosis and reactive plasmacytic infiltration (Figure 1, right). Careful inspection of the pyogenic granulomatous process at higher power demonstrated atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Treat with cryotherapy', 'B. Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen', 'C. Perform tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms', 'D.

The patient's history of immunosuppression due to kidney transplants and the medications she is taking, combined with the recurrent nature of the lesion and the presence of atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels, raises suspicion for a possible malignancy. Pyogenic granuloma is a benign condition, but it can mimic or be associated with malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma or amelanotic melanoma. Therefore, further investigation with immunohistochemical analysis is warranted to rule out these possibilities.

The other options are less appropriate. Cryotherapy is a treatment option for pyogenic granuloma, but given the atypical findings and the patient's immunosuppressed state, it would be premature to proceed with this without further investigation. Tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms could be considered given the purulent drainage, but this would not address the atypical cells found on biopsy. Providing reassurance without further investigation would also be inappropriate given the concerning findings.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description and histopathological findings provide sufficient information to make a decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",B,"Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen.

I chose this answer because the patient's presentation is concerning for an atypical pyogenic granuloma.

The patient has a history of pyogenic granuloma, but the recurrence and the new symptoms such as pain, partial nail loss, and purulent drainage suggest that there might be more to the story. The presence of atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels in the pyogenic granulomatous process is also concerning. Immunohistochemical analysis can help further evaluate the nature of these atypical cells and potentially identify any additional underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen.

The patient's history of pyogenic granuloma, partial nail loss, and painful nail bed ulceration, along with the presence of atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels in the pyogenic granulomatous process, suggest a possible diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma with atypical features. However, the presence of atypical cells raises the possibility of a more aggressive or malignant process, such as a squamous cell carcinoma.

Immunohistochemical analysis can help to further characterize the nature of the atypical cells and determine whether they are indeed malignant. Specifically, staining for markers such as cytokeratin and p63 can help to differentiate between benign and malignant epithelial cells. Additionally, staining for markers such as CD34 and CD10 can help to identify the presence of vascular and fibroblastic cells, respectively, which can provide further insight into the nature of the lesion.

Therefore, I would recommend performing immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen to further evaluate the nature of the atypical cells and determine the most appropriate course of action.

The patient's symptoms of poor vision, photophobia, and congenital horizontal nystagmus, along with the physical findings of fair skin, platinum white hair, and blue eyes that appear reddish-pink under retro-illumination, suggest a possible diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). OCA is a group of inherited disorders characterized by a reduction or complete lack of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The visual abnormalities in OCA are caused by abnormal development of the retina and abnormal patterns of nerve connections between the eye and the brain. 

A dilated ophthalmic examination would allow for a more detailed assessment of the patient's ocular structures and could reveal characteristic findings of OCA, such as foveal hypoplasia, iris transillumination defects, and misrouting of the optic nerves at the chiasm. This examination would be an important next step in confirming the diagnosis and assessing the extent of the patient's ocular abnormalities.

The history of cutaneous melanoma is not typical in OCA, but it could be related to the patient's fair skin and increased susceptibility to sun damage. 

The other options are less relevant in this case. Molecular genetic testing could potentially confirm a diagnosis of OCA, but it would be more appropriate to perform a thorough clinical evaluation first. There is no indication from the patient's history to suggest a problem with frequent infections or abnormal bleeding.

The patient's symptoms of poor vision and photophobia, along with her fair skin and blue eyes, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular albinism. This condition is characterized by a reduction or absence of pigmentation in the eyes, which can lead to visual impairment and increased sensitivity to light. A dilated ophthalmic examination would allow the doctor to assess the patient's retina and choroids for signs of ocular albinism, such as hypopigmentation, macular hypoplasia, and abnormalities in the retinal vasculature.

The patient's presentation of fever, rash, and diarrhea following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is suggestive of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a common complication of HSCT where the donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells view the recipient's body as foreign and attack the body. The skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly affected. The rash in acute GVHD is typically maculopapular and may be pruritic, as in this patient. Diarrhea can also be a manifestation of gastrointestinal involvement.

The treatment for GVHD involves immunosuppression, typically with systemic corticosteroids. Therefore, the next step would be to discontinue antibiotic therapy, as it appears to be ineffective, and consider systemic corticosteroids.

The other options are less likely. Empirical antiviral and antifungal therapy would not be indicated without specific signs or symptoms suggesting these infections. Ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing could be used to assess for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but this patient's presentation is more consistent with GVHD. Bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions would not be indicated as the patient does not have respiratory symptoms.

The patient's presentation of fever, skin rash, diarrhea, and weight gain after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation raises suspicion for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a common complication of stem cell transplantation and can manifest with skin involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms, and liver dysfunction. Ferritin and soluble IL2Rα are markers that can help in the diagnosis and monitoring of GVHD.

Initiating empirical antiviral and antifungal therapy would not be the first-line approach in this case, as the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are more consistent with GVHD rather than an infectious etiology.

Discontinuing antibiotic therapy and considering systemic corticosteroids may be an option if there is a concern for an allergic reaction or drug-induced rash. However, given the patient's history of multiple myeloma and recent stem cell transplantation, GVHD is a more likely diagnosis and should be investigated further.

Performing bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions is not indicated based on the information provided. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest pulmonary involvement, and there is no mention of respiratory symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,The correct answer is: Obtain ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing,C,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to obtain ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing.

The patient's symptoms of fever, diarrhea, and weight gain, along with the development of new-onset pruritic, confluent, erythematous, blanching morbilliform macules and papules on his trunk and extremities, suggest a possible diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a common complication of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but it can also occur after autologous transplantation, as in this case.

Ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing can help support the diagnosis of GVHD. Ferritin is a protein that is produced in response to inflammation and is often elevated in patients with GVHD. Soluble IL2Rα (sIL2Rα) is a marker of activated T cells, which are involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD.

Initiating empirical antiviral and antifungal therapy without further evaluation may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and may also expose the patient to unnecessary side effects. Discontinuing antibiotic therapy and considering systemic corticosteroids may be appropriate, but first, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of GVHD.

The other options, such as treating with cryotherapy or pulsed dye laser therapy, may be considered after a proper diagnosis has been made.",A,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain.

The patient's history of a gradually growing pink nodule on the left cheek, with pruritus and occasional bleeding, suggests a possible diagnosis of a benign skin lesion, such as a dermal nevus or a sebaceous hyperplasia. However, the presence of central erosions on the nodule raises the possibility of a more aggressive lesion, such as a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

A biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain would allow for a histopathological evaluation of the lesion, which would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. This is the most appropriate choice among the options given, as fungal culture and pulsed dye laser therapy are not typically used for the evaluation and treatment of skin lesions, and cryotherapy may not be effective for a nodular lesion of this size.

Justification for the answer:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a benign skin lesion, but the presence of central erosions and the patient's age suggest the possibility of a more aggressive lesion. A biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain would provide valuable diagnostic information and help to guide further management.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2635609,"A 56-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass. She experienced no symptoms of weight loss, headache, sweating, palpitations, pallor, anxiety, menstrual abnormalities, or mood changes; had no known history of cancer or hypertension; and was not taking any medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 135/73 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 82/min. There was no truncal or facial obesity, acne, striae, hirsutism, or proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory analysis showed normal blood cell counts and levels of electrolytes, liver enzymes, and lactate dehydrogenase. Further biochemical evaluation revealed normal levels of plasma and urinary cortisol, serum aldosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and urinary metanephrines. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 5.5 × 4.3–cm left adrenal tumor with heterogeneous appearance, a hypodense central area, and irregular margins, with a density of 36 Hounsfield units (HU). Relative and absolute adrenal washout values (a measure of the disappearance of contrast media from a mass after 10 minutes) were 23% and 47%, respectively. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) was performed for further tumor characterization (Figure).",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform a biopsy of the mass', 'B. Order a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months', 'C. Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy', 'D. Perform adrenal magnetic resonance imaging']",C,C,"The correct course of action would be to ""Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy"". 

The patient's adrenal mass is large (5.5 x 4.3 cm), has irregular margins, and a heterogeneous appearance with a hypodense central area, all of which are concerning features. The density of the mass is 36 HU, which is higher than the 10 HU cut-off typically used to characterize adrenal adenomas, suggesting that this mass may not be benign. The adrenal washout values are also not typical for a benign adenoma. Furthermore, the patient's biochemical evaluation does not suggest a functional adrenal tumor, as there are no elevated hormone levels. 

Given these findings, the mass is suspicious for malignancy, and surgical removal is typically the recommended course of action for potentially malignant adrenal masses. A biopsy is generally not recommended due to the risk of tumor spillage, and repeat imaging or further imaging with MRI would not likely provide additional useful information in this case.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy. 

The patient's adrenal mass is incidentally discovered and does not present with any symptoms or signs suggestive of hormone excess or malignancy. The laboratory analysis also shows normal levels of various hormones and enzymes. However, the CT scan reveals a large adrenal tumor with irregular margins and a hypodense central area, which raises suspicion for malignancy. Additionally, the relative and absolute adrenal washout values suggest a low likelihood of a benign adrenal adenoma.

Given these findings, a surgical consult for adrenalectomy is warranted to further evaluate and potentially remove the adrenal mass. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and treatment, as well as the possibility of preventing any potential complications or progression of the tumor.

In this case, a biopsy of the mass or a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months would not provide sufficient information to guide management. Adrenal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.

Justification: The information provided in the case suggests a potential malignancy based on the CT scan findings and the low adrenal washout values. Adrenalectomy would allow for histopathological examination of the tumor, which is necessary for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management.

Medical image requirement: False. The information provided is sufficient to make a decision without the need for a corresponding medical image.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy. The patient has an incidentally discovered adrenal mass with a size of 5.5 × 4.3–cm, which is considered to be a significant size for an adrenal tumor. The patient has undergone a CT scan and a PET/CT scan, which have provided additional information about the tumor's characteristics. However, the definitive diagnosis of the tumor can only be made through a biopsy or surgical removal of the mass. Therefore, a surgical consult for adrenalectomy is the most appropriate next step.",C,"Based on the information provided, I would recommend option 3: Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the adrenal mass is likely to be a benign adrenocortical tumor, such as a cortical adenoma or a benign adrenocortical tumor of uncertain malignant potential (BAT-UMP). The heterogeneous appearance, irregular margins, and low density on CT scan are consistent with a benign adrenocortical tumor. Additionally, the washout values on the PET/CT scan suggest that the tumor is not highly metabolically active, which is consistent with a benign tumor.

Given the patient's age and the presence of a large adrenal mass, it is important to consider the possibility of malignancy. However, based on the current information, the likelihood of malignancy appears to be low. Therefore, I would recommend requesting a surgical consult for adrenalectomy to remove the mass and establish a definitive diagnosis.

If the patient had a history of symptoms suggestive of hypercortisolism, such as weight gain, hypertension, or diabetes, or if the laboratory results showed abnormal cortisol levels, I would consider performing a biopsy of the mass (option 1) to establish a diagnosis of an adrenocortical carcinoma. However, in the absence of these findings, surgical resection is the most appropriate next step.

Option 2, ordering a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months, may be appropriate if the patient had a smaller adrenal mass or if there were concerns about the stability of the mass. However, given the size of the mass and the patient's age, it is more appropriate to proceed with surgical resection.

Option 4, performing adrenal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be useful in certain cases, such as when there is a concern about the mass's effects on the surrounding tissues or when there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. However, in this case, the CT scan and PET/CT scan have already provided valuable information, and MRI is not necessary at this time.

Justify: True. The question requires the doctor to evaluate the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies, and to make a decision about the next step in management. The answer chosen is based on the information provided and the doctor's clinical judgment.",jama

She reported that the mass had been present for 2 to 3 weeks and was increasing in size. It was not painful but bled when she brushed her teeth or ate sharp foods, which made it difficult to eat. There was no discharge from the area. She had no fevers, no trauma to the area, and no history of a similar condition.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Prescribe a course of prednisone', 'B. Perform a needle biopsy', 'C. Refer to an oral surgeon for excision', 'D. Recommend watchful waiting']",C,C,"The correct course of action in this case would be to ""Refer to an oral surgeon for excision"". 

The patient's symptoms suggest a pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign vascular lesion that commonly occurs in the oral cavity during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. These lesions can bleed easily and can cause discomfort, as the patient has described. 

While a needle biopsy could be used to confirm the diagnosis, it's not typically the first step because it can cause bleeding in these highly vascular lesions. Prednisone, a type of steroid, is not typically used to treat this condition. Watchful waiting is not appropriate in this case because the lesion is causing discomfort and bleeding.

Therefore, referral to an oral surgeon for excision is the most appropriate next step. The surgeon can remove the lesion and confirm the diagnosis with a post-operative biopsy.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient to an oral surgeon for excision of the soft-tissue mass on her upper maxillary gingiva. This is because the mass has been present for a few weeks, is increasing in size, and is causing difficulty in eating due to bleeding. These characteristics suggest that the mass may be a tumor or growth that requires further evaluation and possible removal. A needle biopsy may be considered if the oral surgeon deems it necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Prescribing prednisone or recommending watchful waiting would not be appropriate in this case as the symptoms are worsening and affecting the patient's daily life.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",R,"The correct answer is: Refer to an oral surgeon for excision.

Explanation: The patient is presenting with a soft-tissue mass on her upper maxillary gingiva, which is causing discomfort and bleeding when she brushes her teeth or eats sharp foods. The mass has been present for 2 to 3 weeks and is increasing in size. Given the location and symptoms of the mass, it is likely a pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign growth that can occur in the gums during pregnancy. While pyogenic granulomas are usually harmless, they can cause discomfort and bleeding, and may require removal. Therefore, the best course of action would be to refer the patient to an oral surgeon for excision of the mass. Prescribing a course of prednisone or recommending watchful waiting would not be appropriate, as the mass is likely to continue growing and causing symptoms. Performing a needle biopsy would not be necessary, as the diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma can be made based on the clinical presentation and location of the mass.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to perform a needle biopsy.

A needle biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can help to diagnose the nature of the soft-tissue mass on the patient's upper maxillary gingiva. It involves using a thin needle to collect a sample of tissue from the mass, which can then be sent to a laboratory for analysis.

The patient's symptoms, such as bleeding when brushing teeth or eating sharp foods, and the fact that the mass has been increasing in size over 2-3 weeks, suggest that it may be a benign tumor or a inflammatory lesion. However, it is important to rule out the possibility of a more serious condition, such as cancer, and a needle biopsy can help to do this.

Prescribing a course of prednisone, a steroid medication, may help to reduce inflammation, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis. Referring to an oral surgeon for excision may be necessary if the mass is found to be benign, but it is premature to consider surgical intervention at this point. Watchful waiting is not recommended, as the patient's symptoms are persistent and the mass is increasing in size, which suggests that it may be a serious condition that requires attention.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Perform a needle biopsy.

The patient's presentation of a diffuse rash and joint pain, which initially responded to prednisone but recurred upon tapering, suggests a possible autoimmune or inflammatory condition. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of a skin biopsy can help identify immune-mediated skin diseases, such as vasculitis or autoimmune bullous disorders, which could be responsible for the patient's symptoms. 

While checking serologies for infections and ANA could be useful in certain contexts, they are less likely to be helpful in this case given the patient's specific symptoms and history. Prescribing a slow and prolonged tapering regimen of steroids could potentially alleviate symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's presentation of a diffuse rash, bilateral elbow and knee pain, and a history of diverticulitis and colovesical fistula, the most appropriate next step would be to check serologies for hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, and streptococcal infections.

Checking antinuclear antibody (ANA) may be considered if an autoimmune etiology is suspected, but given the patient's history and presentation, infectious causes should be ruled out first.

Performing direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy may be helpful if there is a suspicion of a specific dermatologic condition, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this case.

Prescribing steroids with a slow and prolonged tapering regimen may be considered if an autoimmune or inflammatory condition is suspected, but again, ruling out infectious causes should be the first step.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"Check antinuclear antibody (ANA)

The patient has presented with a diffuse rash and joint pain, which could indicate an autoimmune condition. Checking the antinuclear antibody (ANA) level can help identify if the patient has an autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, which can present with similar symptoms.

Justification for not choosing other options:
- Checking serologies for hepatitis, HIV, parvovirus, and streptococcal infections may be relevant, but these are not directly related to the rash and joint pain symptoms. Moreover, there is no specific indication in the case to suspect these infections.
- Performing direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy could be useful in determining the presence of immune-mediated skin disease, but ANA testing is a more logical first step to narrow down the possible autoimmune conditions before proceeding to more specific tests.
- Prescribing steroids with a slow and prolonged tapering regimen may be considered after identifying the underlying cause of the symptoms and evaluating the effectiveness of steroids in managing the condition.",C,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 3: Perform direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy.

The patient's history of recurrent episodes of diverticulitis complicated by colovesical fistula, and the recent onset of a diffuse rash, bilateral elbow and knee pain, and the failure of prednisone therapy to control the rash, suggest a possible autoimmune disorder. The presence of a skin rash and joint pain are consistent with several autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis.

A skin biopsy with DIF evaluation would help to confirm the diagnosis of an autoimmune skin disorder and would be the next step in the diagnostic workup. DIF is a technique that uses fluorescent dyes to detect the presence of antibodies or complement proteins in the skin, which can help to identify the underlying autoimmune disorder.

Option 1: Checking serologies for hepatitis, HIV, parvovirus, and streptococcal infections may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup, as the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a viral or bacterial infection.

The infant's symptoms of fever and facial rash, along with the mother's positive IgG antibodies against rubella virus and herpes zoster virus, suggest a possible autoimmune or infectious disease. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody tests are used to diagnose conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome, which can present with similar symptoms. These tests could help rule out these conditions or confirm a diagnosis.

The mother's serology findings were negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis, so it's less likely that the infant has contracted one of these infections. Therefore, a serologic test for syphilis for the infant may not be necessary at this point. 

The infant's symptoms are not typical of a fungal infection, so administering topical antifungals may not be the most appropriate next step. Similarly, providing education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing may not address the underlying cause of the infant's symptoms.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother. 

The infant's presentation of fevers and facial rash raises suspicion for a possible autoimmune condition known as neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). NLE is a rare condition that can occur in infants born to mothers with certain autoantibodies, such as anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause inflammation and tissue damage in the infant.

Ordering these specific antibody tests for both the infant and the mother will help confirm or rule out the presence of these autoantibodies, which would be crucial in diagnosing NLE. If the tests come back positive, further evaluation and management can be initiated.

The other options provided, such as providing education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing, administering topical antifungals, or ordering a serologic test for syphilis, are not indicated based on the given clinical presentation and history.",C,"The correct answer is: Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

Explanation: The infant is presenting with a facial rash and fever, and there is no clear indication of the cause of the rash. The history provided does not suggest a specific diagnosis, so further testing is necessary to determine the cause of the rash. The presence of antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibodies in the infant and his mother could indicate a congenital or inherited condition that is causing the rash. It is important to rule out these potential causes before considering other treatment options such as topical antifungals or education on facial cleansing and moisturizing. Additionally, the infant's mother has a negative history of ringworm infection, so it is unlikely that this is the cause of the rash. Therefore, ordering a serologic test for syphilis for the infant is not necessary at this time.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

The patient's symptoms of fever and facial rash, along with the history of a normal pregnancy and birth, suggest the possibility of a congenital infection. The presence of a rash on the face increases the likelihood of a viral infection, and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of infection in the mother suggests that the infection is unlikely to be due to herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus.

The antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing can help to diagnose congenital infections such as neonatal lupus, which is caused by the transfer of autoantibodies from the mother to the fetus. This condition can present with symptoms such as fever, rash, and liver or heart disease.

Providing education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing may be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent or necessary step at this time. Administering topical antifungals without a proper diagnosis could be ineffective and potentially harmful. Ordering a serologic test for syphilis for the infant may be necessary, but it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and history.

The patient's history of stage 4 chronic kidney disease, recent strenuous activity, and progression from oliguria to anuria suggest acute kidney injury (AKI) on top of chronic kidney disease. The most likely cause in this case is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a serious syndrome due to a direct or indirect muscle injury. It results from the death of muscle fibers and release of their contents into the bloodstream. This can lead to serious complications such as renal failure, which is why the patient's anuria is concerning.

A renal biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis of ATN and rule out other causes of AKI. The other options are not as relevant to the patient's presentation. IV fluids and furosemide might be used in the management of AKI, but it's important to establish a diagnosis first. Bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy is used for multiple myeloma, which there's no indication of in this case.

A renal biopsy would help to confirm the diagnosis of kidney disease and would provide valuable information about the nature and severity of the disease. This information would be essential in determining the appropriate course of treatment.

Continuing IV fluids and administering furosemide may help to manage the patient's fluid status, but it would not address the underlying cause of the anuria. Initiating bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy would be inappropriate at this time, as it is not clear that the patient has multiple myeloma, and this treatment is not indicated for chronic kidney disease.

He was born in the United States but had traveled to Sierra Leone for a period of 3 weeks and had returned 1 week prior to presentation. He did not take any form of malaria prophylaxis, nor did he use insect repellent while traveling. He previously received the yellow fever vaccine but not hepatitis A or typhoid vaccination.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Start artemether-lumefantrine', 'B. Start chloroquine', 'C. Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline', 'D. Perform an exchange transfusion']",C,C,"The correct answer is: Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline.

The patient's symptoms and recent travel history to Sierra Leone, a region endemic for malaria, strongly suggest a diagnosis of severe malaria. The patient's confusion indicates cerebral involvement, which is a sign of severe disease. Artemether-lumefantrine and chloroquine are used for uncomplicated malaria, but severe malaria requires more aggressive treatment. 

Intravenous quinidine gluconate is the recommended treatment for severe malaria in the United States, and it is often combined with doxycycline. Exchange transfusion was previously recommended for severe malaria, but recent guidelines suggest that it does not improve outcomes and is not routinely recommended.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's travel history to Sierra Leone, the symptoms of fever, weakness, fatigue, and confusion, and the lack of malaria prophylaxis, the most likely diagnosis is malaria. Therefore, the next step would be to start artemether-lumefantrine, which is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum.

Artemether-lumefantrine is a combination therapy that is highly effective against P. falciparum malaria and is well-tolerated. It is available in oral form and is usually given as a 3-day course.

The other options listed are not appropriate in this case:
- Chloroquine is no longer recommended for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria in most regions due to widespread resistance.
- Intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline are not the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria.
- Exchange transfusion is not indicated in uncomplicated malaria.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is malaria. The patient did not take any form of malaria prophylaxis and did not use insect repellent while traveling to Sierra Leone, which is a country with a high risk of malaria transmission. The patient's symptoms of fever, extreme weakness, fatigue, and confusion are consistent with severe malaria. Therefore, the next step would be to start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline, which are the recommended drugs for the treatment of severe malaria. Artemether-lumefantrine and chloroquine are not recommended for the treatment of severe malaria, and an exchange transfusion is not indicated in this case.",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, I would choose option 2: Start chloroquine.

Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the most severe form of malaria. The patient's symptoms of fever, weakness, fatigue, and confusion are consistent with malaria. Additionally, the patient traveled to Sierra Leone, an area where malaria is endemic, and did not take any form of malaria prophylaxis or use insect repellent, which increases the likelihood of malaria.

It's important to note that artemether-lumefantrine (option 1) is also an effective antimalarial drug, but it's not the first line treatment for severe malaria, which the patient seems to have. Intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline (option 3) may be considered in severe cases of malaria, but the patient's symptoms do not seem to warrant this treatment yet. Exchange transfusion (option 4) is not a recommended treatment for malaria.

Justification for the answer:

The patient's symptoms and travel history suggest a high likelihood of malaria. Chloroquine is an effective antimalarial drug that is commonly used to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the most severe form of the disease. It's important to start treatment promptly to prevent complications and reduce the risk of death.

She was previously healthy, did not consume alcohol, and had no personal or family history of liver disease. She took no prescription medications; however, approximately 6 months prior to the onset of symptoms, she began taking a nutritional supplement (Nature Made Beta Carotene, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) manufactured in Japan and available online in China. This supplement contained 1.8 mg of beta carotene per tablet, and she had been taking 2 tablets daily for the past 6 months. She had no other dietary changes during this period, in particular, no increased intake of carrots or other yellow- or orange-colored fruits or vegetables. Physical examination revealed yellow-orange pigmentation of her palms and soles (Figure). There was no scleral icterus. Results of laboratory tests, including measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, hemoglobin A1c, and total and direct bilirubin levels, ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine, as well as fasting lipid profile and thyroid function tests, were normal.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform a biopsy', 'B. Order repeat liver function tests', 'C. Empirically treat with a topical steroid', 'D. Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement']",D,D,"The correct answer is: Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement.

The patient's symptoms of yellowing skin on her palms and soles, without any signs of liver disease or abnormal liver function tests, suggest carotenemia, which is a harmless condition caused by high levels of carotene in the blood. The most common cause of carotenemia is excessive intake of carotene-rich foods, such as carrots and sweet potatoes, but it can also be caused by dietary supplements containing beta carotene, as in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement. 

Performing a biopsy or ordering repeat liver function tests would not be necessary as the patient's liver function tests are normal and there is no indication of liver disease. Empirically treating with a topical steroid would not be appropriate as this is not a skin condition caused by inflammation or an immune response, but rather a systemic condition related to the patient's diet.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement. 

The patient's history and physical examination findings suggest that the yellowing of the skin on her palms and soles is likely due to excessive intake of beta carotene from the nutritional supplement. Beta carotene is a precursor of vitamin A and excessive intake can lead to a condition called carotenemia, which causes yellow-orange discoloration of the skin. 

Since the patient's liver function tests and other laboratory results were normal, there is no indication for a biopsy or repeat liver function tests at this time. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the use of topical steroids in this case. 

Therefore, advising the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement would be the most appropriate next step. 

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"I would advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement. The patient's symptoms of yellowing skin on her palms and soles, along with the history of taking a nutritional supplement containing beta carotene, suggest that she may be experiencing a side effect of the supplement. Beta carotene is a yellow pigment found in many fruits and vegetables, and excessive intake can cause yellowing of the skin. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the supplement is causing the patient's symptoms. Before performing a biopsy or treating with a topical steroid, it is important to identify the underlying cause of the symptoms. Repeat liver function tests may be necessary to rule out liver disease, but the normal results of the initial tests suggest that liver disease is unlikely.",D,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement.

The patient's symptoms of yellowing skin on her palms and soles, also known as carotenemia, are likely due to the high levels of beta carotene in the supplement she has been taking. Beta carotene is a fat-soluble vitamin that can accumulate in the skin and other tissues, leading to a yellow-orange discoloration. The fact that the patient has been taking a large dose of beta carotene (1.8 mg per tablet) and has not had any other dietary changes that could explain the symptoms, suggests that the supplement is the likely cause.

Discontinuing the supplement would be a reasonable first step in managing the patient's symptoms. If the patient's symptoms resolve after discontinuing the supplement, it would support the diagnosis of carotenemia. Additionally, it would be prudent to monitor the patient's liver function tests and perform repeat tests to ensure that there is no underlying liver dysfunction.

Performing a biopsy would not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest any underlying liver disease. Ordering repeat liver function tests would be appropriate, but it would not be the most appropriate next step. Empirically treating the patient with a topical steroid would not be effective in resolving the patient's symptoms, as the cause of the symptoms is not related to a skin condition.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement.

Justify:
The patient's symptoms of carotenemia are likely due to the high levels of beta carotene in the supplement she has been taking. Discontinuing the supplement would be a reasonable first step in managing the patient's symptoms and would allow for monitoring of the patient's symptoms and liver function tests to ensure resolution of the symptoms and rule out any underlying liver dysfunction.

One day prior to presentation, he went to a local emergency department, where he was prescribed clindamycin and valacyclovir. The patient works as a plumber and attributed his tender rash to a “spider bite” he had incurred while working in an old building. The patient was afebrile, and physical examination revealed several vesicles with purulent fluid on an erythematous base, at the base of the left thumb (Figure). There was no lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or mucous membrane involvement. The rash was not found elsewhere on the body. Vesicular fluid was collected and sent for further analysis.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform local incision and debridement', 'B. Admit to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy', 'C. Instruct the patient to take only the valacyclovir', 'D. Instruct the patient to take only the clindamycin']",C,D,"The correct answer is: Instruct the patient to take only the clindamycin.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a bacterial skin infection, specifically a type of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus infection. These bacteria are common causes of skin infections and can cause symptoms such as redness, swelling, and the formation of pus-filled blisters or abscesses. The patient's occupation as a plumber and the recent ""spider bite"" could have exposed him to these bacteria.

Clindamycin is an antibiotic that is effective against these types of bacteria. Therefore, it is appropriate to instruct the patient to continue taking this medication to treat his infection.

Valacyclovir, on the other hand, is an antiviral medication. It is typically used to treat viral infections such as herpes simplex or varicella-zoster. Given the patient's symptoms and the absence of other signs of a viral infection (such as fever or mucous membrane involvement), it is less likely that a virus is the cause of his symptoms. Therefore, it would not be necessary for him to continue taking this medication.

Performing a local incision and debridement or admitting the patient to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy would be more invasive and intensive treatments that are not necessary given the current presentation of the patient's symptoms.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the patient's symptoms and history is sufficient to make a diagnosis and treatment recommendation. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to admit the patient to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy. 

The patient's presentation with an exquisitely tender rash, vesicles with purulent fluid, and a history of a ""spider bite"" suggests a possible herpetic whitlow, which is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). This infection typically affects the fingers and is commonly seen in healthcare workers or individuals with frequent exposure to moist environments. 

Intravenous antiviral therapy, such as acyclovir, is the treatment of choice for herpetic whitlow, especially in severe cases or in immunocompromised individuals. Oral antiviral therapy alone may not be sufficient in this case, given the severity of the symptoms and the potential for complications. Admitting the patient to the hospital allows for close monitoring and administration of intravenous medications.

Performing local incision and debridement is not indicated in this case as it may lead to further complications and is not the primary treatment for herpetic whitlow.

Instructing the patient to take only valacyclovir or clindamycin alone would not be sufficient to adequately treat the infection. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that can be used in the treatment of HSV infections, but in this case, intravenous antiviral therapy is warranted. Clindamycin is an antibiotic and would not be effective against a viral infection.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"The correct answer is: Instruct the patient to take only the clindamycin

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a bacterial infection, likely caused by the spider bite. The presence of purulent fluid and the absence of lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or mucous membrane involvement suggest that the infection is localized and has not spread. Therefore, the best course of action is to instruct the patient to take only the clindamycin, which is an antibiotic that can effectively treat the bacterial infection. There is no indication for intravenous antiviral therapy, as there is no evidence of a viral infection. Local incision and debridement may be necessary if the infection worsens or does not respond to antibiotic treatment.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to admit the patient to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy. The patient's symptoms, including the tender rash and purulent fluid, suggest a possible viral infection. The fact that the patient works as a plumber and attributes the rash to a ""spider bite"" suggests that the infection may be related to a bite or exposure to a virus. The patient's recent visit to the emergency department and prescription of clindamycin and valacyclovir also support the possibility of a viral infection.

Intravenous antiviral therapy would be the most appropriate next step in order to effectively treat the patient's infection and prevent further complications. Local incision and debridement may be necessary later on, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's care. Instructing the patient to take only the valacyclovir or clindamycin may not be sufficient to treat the infection, as the patient may require a combination of medications or a different treatment altogether.

Therefore, the answer is:

B. Admit to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest an exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dyspnea on exertion and the need for increasing oxygen flow rates are common signs of a COPD exacerbation. Parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators are standard treatments for acute exacerbations of COPD. They help to reduce inflammation and open up the airways, respectively, thereby improving symptoms.

The other options involve anticoagulation therapy or surgical interventions, which are typically used for conditions like pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. However, the patient's symptoms and history do not specifically suggest these conditions.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image to make a decision, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

The patient's increasing dyspnea on exertion and the need for increasing flow rates of oxygen suggest a worsening of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the fact that he has a 50-pack-year history of smoking and a history of stage I low-grade prostate cancer raises concern for the possibility of pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lungs. Given the patient's risk factors and symptoms, it is important to consider this possibility. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary embolism, and referral for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy would be appropriate to assess the extent of the disease and determine if surgical intervention is necessary.

Parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators would be more appropriate for exacerbations of COPD, but in this case, the symptoms and risk factors suggest a different underlying cause.

Starting heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months would be appropriate for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, but without further information, it is unclear if this is the correct diagnosis in this case.

Surgical embolectomy may be considered in cases of massive or submassive pulmonary embolism, but it is not the initial treatment of choice and would not be appropriate without further evaluation.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"The correct answer is: Start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest that he may have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, which is a rare complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This condition is caused by recurrent pulmonary embolism and can be treated with anticoagulation and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Therefore, it is important to start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for this surgical procedure. The other options, such as starting parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators or heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months, are not appropriate for the management of this condition.",D,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increasing dyspnea on exertion suggests that they may have developed pulmonary embolism, which can be confirmed with a medical image such as a CT angiogram or ventilation-perfusion lung scan. The patient's history of smoking and stage I low-grade prostate cancer also increases their risk for pulmonary embolism.

Starting parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators may help manage the patient's COPD symptoms, but it would not address the potential pulmonary embolism. Starting heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months may be appropriate for deep vein thrombosis, but it would not be effective for pulmonary embolism. Surgical embolectomy may be considered for large, proximal pulmonary emboli, but it is not the most appropriate option for this patient.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, which is a surgical procedure that removes plaque and clots from the pulmonary arteries. This procedure can help improve lung function and reduce the risk of complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. Both HSV and VZV can cause grouped vesicles on an erythematous base, which is a classic presentation for these viruses. The patient's occupation, working outdoors for an oil drilling company, does not necessarily increase his risk for these infections, but it does not rule them out either. 

The patient's history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, as well as his medications, are not directly related to his current symptoms. His denial of HIV, hepatitis, chickenpox, or recurrent infections also does not rule out HSV or VZV. 

Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat HSV and VZV infections. Therefore, initiating antiviral therapy with valacyclovir would be the most appropriate next step in this patient's care.

Blood cultures are not typically useful in diagnosing HSV or VZV infections. Oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids may help with symptom management, but they do not treat the underlying viral infection.

Given the clinical presentation, the next step would be to initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir. Antiviral medications, such as valacyclovir, can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as prevent complications associated with herpes zoster.

Obtaining blood cultures would not be necessary in this case, as herpes zoster is a localized viral infection and does not typically cause systemic symptoms or bacteremia.

Prescribing an oral antihistamine agent would not be appropriate in this case, as antihistamines are primarily used to relieve itching and allergic reactions, which are not prominent features of herpes zoster.

Similarly, prescribing a topical corticosteroid cream would not be the first-line treatment for herpes zoster. While corticosteroids may be used in certain cases to reduce inflammation and pain, they are typically reserved for patients with severe pain or complications, and should be used cautiously due to the risk of delaying viral clearance.

The patient's symptoms suggest a drug reaction, possibly to the ibuprofen he took a week prior. Drug reactions can occur up to two weeks after exposure to the offending agent. The rash, fever, and the timeline of the symptoms following the use of ibuprofen are all indicative of a drug reaction. 

Infliximab therapy is typically used for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Oral cephalexin is an antibiotic, which would be used for a bacterial infection, but there's no clear indication of that in this case. An HIV immunoassay would be used if there was a suspicion of HIV infection, but again, the patient's symptoms and history don't point to that.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a drug eruption, specifically an acneiform drug eruption, which is a known side effect of ibuprofen. The timing of the symptoms starting 3 days after taking ibuprofen further supports this possibility. Avoiding further use of ibuprofen is important to prevent exacerbation of the symptoms.

Prescribing a topical steroid can help alleviate the inflammation and reduce the acneiform papules and pustules. Topical steroids have anti-inflammatory properties and can help calm the skin reaction caused by the drug eruption.

Initiating infliximab therapy or oral cephalexin therapy would not be appropriate in this case as they are not indicated for drug eruptions. These treatments are typically used for other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or bacterial infections, respectively.

The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and acneiform papules and pustules could be indicative of a number of conditions, including a viral exanthemata, such as roseola or fifth disease, or a bacterial infection, such as impetigo. However, the patient's recent use of ibuprofen and the rapid progression of the rash suggest that a drug reaction or allergy may also be a possibility.

Given the patient's age and the presence of a rash, it is important to consider the possibility of an HIV-associated opportunistic infection, such as Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma. HIV testing is recommended for all patients with unexplained fever and rash, especially if they have a recent history of travel or have engaged in high-risk behaviors.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to order an HIV immunoassay to determine the patient's HIV status. If the test is positive, further evaluation and management would be necessary to determine the appropriate treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections.

Start intravenous acyclovir', 'B. Start intravenous thrombolysis', 'C. Start parenteral thiamine', 'D. Start systemic corticosteroids']",C,C,"The correct answer is to start parenteral thiamine.

The patient's symptoms of visual disturbances and painful, burning sensations in the lower limbs are suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a condition caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition is often seen in alcoholics, but it can also occur in patients with severe malnutrition, such as those with Crohn's disease, especially after surgery when nutritional intake may be compromised. The nausea and vomiting experienced by the patient prior to surgery could have further depleted his thiamine stores.

Wernicke's encephalopathy is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with parenteral thiamine to prevent progression to Korsakoff's syndrome, which can cause irreversible memory loss. 

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Intravenous acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, intravenous thrombolysis is used for acute stroke or myocardial infarction, and systemic corticosteroids are used for inflammatory conditions, none of which are suggested by the patient's symptoms.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to start parenteral thiamine.

This condition can occur in patients with severe malnutrition, alcoholism, or malabsorption syndromes like Crohn disease. Prompt administration of thiamine is crucial to prevent irreversible neurological damage.

The other options listed are not indicated in this scenario. Intravenous acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, and there is no indication of a viral infection in this patient. Intravenous thrombolysis is used to treat acute ischemic stroke, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms. Systemic corticosteroids are not indicated in the absence of an inflammatory condition.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",A,"Based on the given information, the patient is experiencing symptoms that suggest Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare but serious neurological disorder that can occur after certain infections or surgical procedures. The symptoms include an inability to visually focus on objects and burning pain in the lower limbs. 

The appropriate next step would be to start intravenous acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication that can help treat the underlying infection that may be causing the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Intravenous thrombolysis is not indicated in this case as it is used for the treatment of blood clots, and there is no indication of thrombosis in the given information. Parenteral thiamine is used for the treatment of vitamin B1 deficiency, which is not mentioned in the case. Systemic corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation, but they are not the first-line treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome. 

Therefore, the correct answer is to start intravenous acyclovir.",B,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to start intravenous thrombolysis. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of visual disturbances and burning pain in the lower limbs, both proximally and distally, suggest a possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP is a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can cause a range of symptoms including neurological and musculoskeletal manifestations.

Intravenous thrombolysis with a drug such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a common treatment for TTP, as it helps to dissolve the blood clots and restore blood flow to affected organs. Intravenous thrombolysis is particularly urgent in this case, given the patient's recent history of surgery and the potential for further complications.

Starting intravenous acyclovir may be appropriate if the patient was diagnosed with herpes simplex encephalitis, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. Starting parenteral thiamine may be appropriate if the patient had a diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy, but again, it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. Starting systemic corticosteroids may be appropriate if the patient had a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis, but it is not the most urgent intervention needed at this time.

The patient's symptoms of fever, lethargy, polyarticular arthralgias, and a painful rash on the extensor surfaces of his extremities are suggestive of a systemic inflammatory or autoimmune condition. The rash, in particular, is a key symptom that can provide valuable diagnostic information. A punch skin biopsy would allow for histological examination of the rash, which could help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. 

The other options are not as immediately helpful without more information. Checking an angiotensin-converting enzyme level could be useful in diagnosing conditions like sarcoidosis, but the patient's symptoms are not highly suggestive of this. Stopping azathioprine (an immunosuppressive medication) could be considered if the patient was taking it and it was suspected to be causing side effects, but there's no information given to suggest this. Commencing corticosteroids could help reduce inflammation and symptoms, but it's generally better to have a specific diagnosis before starting such treatment.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a punch skin biopsy. The patient's symptoms of fevers, lethargy, polyarticular arthralgias, and a painful rash on the extensor surfaces of his lower and upper extremities suggest a possible systemic inflammatory condition.

Checking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and presentation do not strongly suggest a specific condition associated with ACE levels.

Stopping azathioprine would not be the immediate next step, as there is no information provided to suggest that the patient is currently taking azathioprine or that it is contributing to his symptoms.

Commencing corticosteroids may be considered as a treatment option once a diagnosis is established, but it would not be the most appropriate next step without further investigation.

Justification for the need for a medical image: False.

This is because the symptoms presented are indicative of a possible autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and a skin biopsy can help confirm this diagnosis. 

Checking angiotensin-converting enzyme level is not necessarily indicative of SLE, as this test is more commonly used to diagnose sarcoidosis. Stopping azathioprine is not relevant to the diagnosis of SLE, as this medication is typically used to treat other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Commencing corticosteroids is not the first step in the diagnosis of SLE, as this medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the disease once it has been confirmed.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Perform a punch skin biopsy.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms of fever, lethargy, and polyarticular arthralgias, in addition to the painful rash, suggest a possible inflammatory condition. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can present with similar symptoms, especially when it involves the extensor surfaces of the extremities.

The patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, skin lesions on her ears, and lower extremity edema, along with her vital signs, suggest a systemic autoimmune condition. The most likely diagnosis in this case is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can present with a variety of symptoms including fever, pleuritis, pericarditis, skin lesions, and kidney disease. The presence of cutaneous necrosis of her pinnae is a specific sign of lupus, known as chilblain lupus.

The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a sensitive screening tool for SLE, and the lupus anticoagulant assay can help confirm the diagnosis. These tests would be the most appropriate next steps in this patient's evaluation.

A skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence could potentially be useful, but it is not the first step in evaluation. Bacterial culture of the skin lesions is not indicated as there is no evidence of infection. A urine drug screen is not relevant in this case as the patient reported no illicit drug use.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings is sufficient to make a diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the patient's presentation of fevers, shortness of breath, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and skin lesions on her ears, along with the physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, tachycardia, lower extremity edema, and bilateral cutaneous necrosis of her pinnae, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a bacterial culture of the skin lesions.

This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an infectious process, and obtaining a bacterial culture would help identify the causative organism and guide appropriate treatment.

Performing a skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence would be more appropriate if there were suspicion for an autoimmune or vasculitic process, which is not indicated in this case.

Obtaining serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay would be more appropriate if there were suspicion for an autoimmune or connective tissue disorder, which is not indicated in this case.

Obtaining a urine drug screen would be more appropriate if there were suspicion for drug-induced symptoms, which is not indicated in this case.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,The correct answer is: Obtain serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay,B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to Obtain serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay.

The patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and skin lesions, along with the physical examination findings of tachycardia, lower extremity edema, and bilateral cutaneous necrosis of her pinnae, suggest a possible autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of bilateral cutaneous necrosis of the pinnae, also known as ""Livedo reticularis,"" is a common finding in patients with SLE.

Therefore, it is important to rule out SLE by performing serological tests such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) and lupus anticoagulant assay. ANA is a common marker of autoimmune disorders, and a positive result would support the diagnosis of SLE. Lupus anticoagulant assay is used to detect the presence of antibodies that can cause blood clots to form, which is a common complication of SLE.

Performing a skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence may also be useful in diagnosing cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Obtaining a bacterial culture of the skin lesions is not necessary, as the patient does not have any signs of bacterial infection. Obtaining a urine drug screen may be appropriate if the patient had a history of illicit drug use, but it is not relevant in this case.

There was no improvement in the rash despite multiple rounds of oral fluconazole, topical antibiotic ointment, and intravenous antibiotics. Prior to development of the rash, he completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. He underwent colostomy after unsuccessful surgical correction for an enterocutaneous fistula and had required total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the past year.

The patient's history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the past year, along with the desquamating rash and diffuse alopecia, strongly suggests a deficiency in a trace element, most likely zinc. Zinc deficiency can cause a rash known as acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is characterized by desquamating dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea. The rash typically begins in periorificial and acral areas and can spread to involve the trunk and extremities. The patient's ostomy output may not have changed because zinc is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, and his colostomy would not affect this.

A skin biopsy could potentially confirm the diagnosis, but it would not identify the underlying cause. Topical steroid cream would not address the underlying deficiency and is unlikely to improve the rash. A paraneoplastic panel is not indicated because the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome.

The presentation of a desquamating rash accompanied by diffuse alopecia in a patient with a history of metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma raises concerns for a paraneoplastic syndrome. A skin biopsy would help to determine the underlying cause of the rash and alopecia, which could be related to the cancer or its treatment. This would provide valuable information for further management and treatment decisions.

Obtaining trace element levels may not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and history suggest a more urgent need for evaluation of the rash and alopecia.

Prescribing a topical steroid cream may provide symptomatic relief for the rash, but it would not address the underlying cause. Given the patient's history of metastatic cancer and lack of improvement with previous treatments, a more comprehensive evaluation is warranted.

Order urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement', 'C. Order active rewarming', 'D. Order urgent hemodialysis']",C,C,"The correct answer is: Order active rewarming.

The patient's symptoms, including being found unresponsive and cold to the touch, along with a low heart rate and low blood pressure, suggest severe hypothermia. Hypothermia can cause a variety of cardiac arrhythmias, including bradycardia (slow heart rate), which is seen in this patient. The ECG may show Osborn waves (also known as J waves), which are indicative of hypothermia but this information is not provided in the question. 

Active rewarming is the treatment of choice for severe hypothermia. This can include methods such as warmed intravenous fluids, warm humidified oxygen, and even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in extreme cases. 

The other options are not as appropriate based on the information given. An emergency coronary angiogram would be more appropriate if there were signs of a heart attack, which are not present here. A temporary transvenous pacemaker would be used for certain types of heart block or bradycardia, but in this case, the bradycardia is likely due to the hypothermia. Urgent hemodialysis would be used in cases of kidney failure or certain types of poisoning, which are not indicated here.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. So, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 79-year-old man with a history of hypertension, stroke, and glaucoma who was found unresponsive. He is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg and bradycardic with a heart rate of 36/min. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation is normal. Multiple temperature measurements did not yield a detectable temperature.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to order active rewarming. The patient's coldness to touch and inability to generate a detectable temperature suggest severe hypothermia. Active rewarming methods, such as warm blankets, warm intravenous fluids, and warm humidified oxygen, should be initiated to raise the patient's core body temperature.

The ECG provided in Figure 1 shows sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 36/min. While this may be related to the patient's hypothermia, it does not indicate the need for urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement at this time.

Emergency coronary angiogram and urgent hemodialysis are not indicated based on the information provided.

Justification: The patient's presentation with hypothermia and bradycardia is consistent with severe hypothermia. Active rewarming is the initial treatment for hypothermia and should be initiated promptly to prevent further complications.

The question does not require the corresponding medical image.",C,The correct answer is: Order active rewarming,C,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 3: Order active rewarming.

The patient's presentation of being unresponsive, cold to the touch, and having a low blood pressure and heart rate suggests that they may be experiencing hypothermia. The absence of a detectable temperature on multiple measurements, including a core temperature assessment via the rectal method, further supports this diagnosis.

Hypothermia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other serious complications, so it is important to actively rewarm the patient. Active rewarming involves the use of external heat sources, such as a warm water bath or a heating blanket, to increase the patient's core temperature. This can help to restore normal cardiac function and prevent further complications.

Ordering an emergency coronary angiogram (option 1) may be appropriate if the patient was experiencing chest pain or had a history of coronary artery disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Ordering urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement (option 2) may be necessary if the patient's bradycardia is caused by a cardiac conduction disturbance, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Ordering urgent hemodialysis (option 4) is not appropriate in this case, as there is no evidence of acute kidney injury or other indications for dialysis.

Justify: True. The patient's presentation and the absence of a detectable temperature on multiple measurements suggest that they may be experiencing hypothermia. Active rewarming is a medical intervention that requires careful monitoring and management, and a medical image such as a chest X-ray or CT scan may not provide sufficient information to diagnose or manage hypothermia.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weight loss, along with her history of iron-deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism, suggest a possible deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate. The elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a common sign of these deficiencies, as they can cause macrocytic anemia. The best next step would be to obtain serum MMA levels, as elevated levels can indicate a B12 deficiency. 

The other options are less likely. Increasing the levothyroxine dose would not address the patient's anemia or elevated MCV. A CT scan to evaluate for lymphadenopathy would not be the first step in evaluating these symptoms and lab findings. Parvovirus B19 can cause anemia, but it typically causes a normocytic anemia, not a macrocytic anemia.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. This is because the patient has a history of iron-deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism, and is currently presenting with fatigue and weight loss. The low hemoglobin level and high mean corpuscular volume suggest a macrocytic anemia, which can be seen in vitamin B12 deficiency. Serum MMA levels can help confirm the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency, as elevated levels are indicative of this condition.

The other options are less likely to be the next step in this case. Increasing the levothyroxine dose may be necessary if the patient's hypothyroidism is not adequately controlled, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the current presentation. Obtaining a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for lymphadenopathy is not indicated based on the information provided. Similarly, sending parvovirus B19 serologies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral DNA is not warranted at this point.

Methylmalonic acid is a metabolite that is produced when the body cannot properly metabolize vitamin B12. Elevated levels of MMA in the blood can indicate a deficiency in vitamin B12, which is important for the production of red blood cells and the maintenance of the nervous system. The patient's low hemoglobin level and history of iron-deficiency anemia suggest that she may have a vitamin B12 deficiency, which could be contributing to her fatigue and weight loss.

Option 1, Increase the levothyroxine dose, may be appropriate if the patient's hypothyroidism is not well-controlled, but it is not directly related to the patient's anemia or recent symptoms.

Option 3, Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for lymphadenopathy, may be necessary if the patient had symptoms suggestive of lymphadenopathy or other signs of cancer, but it is not directly related to the patient's anemia or recent symptoms.

It can cause a range of symptoms, including skin discoloration, kidney damage, and altered mental status, all of which this patient is experiencing. CES is often triggered by procedures like angiography or surgery, which this patient recently underwent.

The other options are less likely. Chest computed tomography angiography might be useful if we suspected a pulmonary embolism, but the patient's symptoms don't strongly suggest this. Surgical consult for amputation might be necessary in the future if the patient's skin condition worsens, but it's not the immediate next step. Starting heparin and discussing thrombolytic therapy would be appropriate if we suspected a blood clot, but again, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with CES.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the patient's symptoms and history is sufficient to make a diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's presentation of altered mental status, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and painful, dusky skin discoloration on his distal extremities, along with his medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and mild aortic stenosis, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation, and monitor for multiorgan damage.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a systemic inflammatory response, which could be due to a condition called cholesterol embolization syndrome (CES). CES occurs when atherosclerotic plaques rupture and release cholesterol crystals into the bloodstream, leading to embolization in small vessels throughout the body. This can result in multiorgan damage, including renal dysfunction, skin findings, and neurologic manifestations.

Obtaining serum liver function tests and lipase level can help assess for potential involvement of other organs, such as the liver and pancreas. An ophthalmologic evaluation is important to assess for signs of retinal emboli, which can further support the diagnosis of CES.

The other options listed are not the most appropriate next steps in this case. Chest computed tomography angiography may be useful in evaluating for pulmonary embolism, but it is not the most relevant investigation given the patient's presentation. Surgical consult for amputation would not be appropriate at this stage without further evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis. Starting heparin and discussing thrombolytic therapy would be premature without a confirmed diagnosis and further assessment of the patient's overall condition.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",B,"The correct answer is: Obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation; monitor for multiorgan damage. 

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of cholesterol embolism, also known as atheroembolism or ""blue toe syndrome."" This condition occurs when cholesterol crystals dislodge from atherosclerotic plaques and travel through the bloodstream, causing blockages in small blood vessels. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent surgery increase the risk of this condition. 

To confirm the diagnosis, liver function tests and lipase levels should be obtained to evaluate for possible pancreatitis, which can be caused by cholesterol embolism. Ophthalmologic evaluation should also be done to assess for any ocular involvement. Monitoring for multiorgan damage is important as cholesterol embolism can affect various organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and brain. 

Starting heparin and discussing thrombolytic therapy may be appropriate if the patient has a thromboembolic event, such as a stroke or myocardial infarction, but it is not indicated for cholesterol embolism. Obtaining chest computed tomography angiography may be useful in evaluating for other conditions, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis of cholesterol embolism. Obtaining a surgical consult for amputation is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms are not indicative of a need for amputation.",B,"Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most appropriate next step would be to Obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation; monitor for multiorgan damage.

The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, acute kidney injury, and painful, dusky skin discoloration on his distal extremities, along with the physical examination findings of tender blue macules, patches, and papules on the plantar aspect of several toes and red, tender macules on his hands, suggest a possible diagnosis of vasculitis or thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient's recent history of coronary angiography and coronary artery bypass graft surgery increases the likelihood of a vasculitis or thrombotic complication.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the patient's liver function, lipase level, and ophthalmologic status to assess for potential multiorgan damage. Additionally, close monitoring of the patient's condition is necessary to watch for any further signs of organ damage or dysfunction.

Starting heparin and discussing thrombolytic therapy with the patient may be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent step at this time. Obtaining chest computed tomography angiography may also be useful in evaluating the patient's coronary arteries, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's current symptoms and recent surgical history. Surgical consult for amputation may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

The neonate's symptoms suggest a severe bacterial infection, possibly neonatal pustular melanosis or a similar condition. This is a serious situation that requires immediate medical intervention. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically the first line of treatment in such cases, as they can combat a wide range of bacteria. 

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Topical steroids are not typically used to treat bacterial infections. Reassuring the parents and watchfully waiting could lead to the condition worsening. A skin biopsy could be useful for confirming the diagnosis, but it should not delay the initiation of antibiotic treatment.

The widespread pustular rash in this neonate requires further investigation, as it could be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, allergies, or other underlying disorders. Obtaining a skin biopsy of the pustules will help in determining the cause and appropriate treatment.

Justification for the answer:

1. The rash's sudden onset and widespread nature make it essential to investigate the cause to ensure proper treatment.
2. The mother's history is benign, which makes it less likely to be a congenital infection commonly associated with maternal history, such as syphilis, genital herpes, varicella, or vaginal candidiasis.
3. Treating with broad-spectrum antibiotics or topical steroids without knowing the exact cause could be ineffective or even harmful.
4. Reassuring the parents and watching the situation could lead to a delay in treatment if the condition worsens or is found to be serious.",A,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to treat the neonate with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The development of a widespread pustular rash on the third day of life, accompanied by erythema over the face and trunk, suggests a possible bacterial infection.

The other options are not appropriate for several reasons:

* Treating with topical steroids would not address the underlying bacterial infection and may even worsen the condition by suppressing the immune system.
* Reassuring the parents and watchfully waiting would not be appropriate given the severity and rapid progression of the rash, and the potential for serious complications if left untreated.
* Obtaining a skin biopsy of the pustules would not be necessary at this stage, as the diagnosis of a bacterial infection is already suggested by the clinical presentation, and biopsy may even delay appropriate treatment.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with erythema ab igne, a reticulated, hyperpigmented dermatosis caused by chronic exposure to moderate heat. It is often seen in patients who use heating pads, laptops, or other heat sources over a long period of time. The condition is generally benign, but there is a small risk of malignant transformation, particularly to squamous cell carcinoma, after many years.

In this case, the patient's lesion is asymptomatic and he has no history of burns or thermal trauma. Therefore, reassurance is the most appropriate next step. The patient should be advised to avoid further heat exposure, which may lead to gradual lightening of the hyperpigmentation over several months to years. If the lesion changes (e.g., becomes painful, pruritic, or ulcerated), then a biopsy should be performed to evaluate for malignancy.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible skin condition that is not responding to valacyclovir treatment, which is typically used for herpes simplex virus. The rash's characteristics, such as being warm, indurated, erythematous plaques with subtle vesicles and collarettes of scale, are not typical for a herpes simplex outbreak, especially given the lack of response to antiviral therapy. 

Discontinuing prednisone is not advisable as it is being used to manage the patient's rheumatoid arthritis, and a recent reduction in dosage has already led to a flare-up of her condition. Starting a topical antifungal agent is not the best choice either, as there's no clear indication of a fungal infection. 

Continuing valacyclovir and waiting could potentially allow the condition to worsen if it is not a herpes simplex outbreak. Therefore, a skin biopsy is the most appropriate next step to determine the exact cause of the rash.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy. The patient's presentation of a painful, pruritic rash with vesicles and collarettes of scale on the left buttock, along with the recent flare of rheumatoid arthritis and use of prednisone, raises concern for the possibility of herpes zoster (shingles) infection. The patient's lack of improvement with valacyclovir, as well as the presence of erythema, edema, and pain in the left wrist joint, further supports this suspicion.

Performing a skin biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis by examining the histopathological features of the rash, such as the presence of multinucleated giant cells and viral inclusions. This would allow for appropriate management and treatment, including the initiation of antiviral therapy if confirmed to be herpes zoster.

A skin biopsy would help to confirm this diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment. While valacyclovir has been started for the patient's genital herpes simplex virus 2 infection, it is unclear if this is the cause of the rash, and therefore continuing valacyclovir and waiting is not the best option. Discontinuing prednisone is also not the best option, as this could potentially worsen the patient's rheumatoid arthritis.

The fact that the patient had recently tapered her prednisone dose and started pregabalin, which can suppress the immune system, increases the likelihood that the rash is related to a viral infection.

A skin biopsy would help to confirm the diagnosis of a viral infection and would also allow for further evaluation for other potential causes of the rash, such as a fungal or bacterial infection.

It is not appropriate to continue valacyclovir and wait, as the patient has already been taking valacyclovir for 1 week without benefit.

The patient's symptoms suggest a fungal infection, specifically tinea capitis, which is a common cause of scalp alopecia in children. Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp hair follicles, which can present with various clinical manifestations, including patches of hair loss with erythema, scaling, and pustules. The patient's history of immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and cyclosporine for nephrotic syndrome could have predisposed him to this infection. Furthermore, the patient's exposure to a pet cat could also be a potential source of infection, as cats can be carriers of dermatophytes.

Therefore, the next best step would be to confirm the diagnosis by obtaining lesional hair roots for examination with a potassium hydroxide solution and fungal culture. This will allow for the identification of the specific fungus causing the infection and guide appropriate treatment.

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible fungal infection, which is common in warm weather and can affect various parts of the body. A KOH analysis is a simple and quick test that can be used to diagnose fungal skin infections. It involves scraping the skin and applying KOH solution to the sample, which dissolves the skin cells and leaves behind the fungal cells, if present.

Patch testing is typically used for diagnosing contact dermatitis, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro antibody levels are used to diagnose autoimmune conditions, but the patient's symptoms don't strongly suggest this.

The patient's symptoms of painful mouth sores, tender crusted plaques on the scalp, and blisters on the skin suggest a possible autoimmune blistering disorder, such as pemphigus vulgaris. This condition is characterized by painful oral and skin blisters and erosions, and is more common in individuals of certain ethnic backgrounds, including those of African descent. The patient's history of chemical hair treatment could potentially have triggered an autoimmune response leading to the development of this condition.

A skin biopsy for immunofluorescence is the most appropriate next step in this case, as it can help confirm the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris or another autoimmune blistering disorder. This test involves taking a small sample of the patient's skin and examining it under a microscope using special fluorescent dyes that can highlight the presence of certain immune proteins.

Oral acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes infections, which does not seem to be the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. A renal biopsy would be more appropriate for a patient with symptoms of kidney disease, which this patient does not have. Oral corticosteroids could potentially be used to treat an autoimmune blistering disorder, but a definitive diagnosis should be made before starting treatment.

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly.",D,"Based on the patient's presentation of bleeding mouth sores, tender crusted plaques on the scalp, and blisters on the skin, along with a history of painful erosions in the mouth and pruritic lesions on the scalp, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy for immunofluorescence.

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of a possible autoimmune blistering disorder, such as pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceus. These conditions are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that target proteins involved in cell adhesion within the skin and mucous membranes. A skin biopsy for immunofluorescence can help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the presence of these autoantibodies.

Performing a renal biopsy or treating with oral acyclovir would not be appropriate in this case, as there are no indications of renal involvement or viral infection. Treating with oral corticosteroids may be considered after confirming the diagnosis, as they are the mainstay of treatment for autoimmune blistering disorders.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",D,"Perform skin biopsy for immunofluorescence. The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, which is a rare autoimmune disease that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. A skin biopsy for immunofluorescence can help confirm the diagnosis by detecting the presence of antibodies in the skin tissue. Treatment with oral corticosteroids and oral acyclovir may be considered after the diagnosis is confirmed. There is no indication for a renal biopsy in this case.",D,"Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy for immunofluorescence. The patient's symptoms of painful erosions throughout her mouth, blisters on her skin, and tender crusted plaques on her scalp, as well as her history of pruritic and painful lesions on her scalp that appeared after a chemical hair treatment, suggest a possible diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes.

Immunofluorescence testing can help to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein 1 and/or desmoglein 3, which are proteins that play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the skin's basement membrane. Immunofluorescence testing can also help to differentiate pemphigus vulgaris from other autoimmune skin disorders, such as bullous pemphigoid, which may have similar symptoms and appearance.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Perform skin biopsy for immunofluorescence.

* Treatment with oral acyclovir (option A) may be effective for herpes simplex virus infections, but it is not appropriate for the management of pemphigus vulgaris.
* Renal biopsy (option B) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest any renal involvement.
* Oral corticosteroids (option C) may be used in the management of pemphigus vulgaris, but they should be used with caution and in combination with other immunosuppressive medications, as they can have side effects and may not be effective in all patients.

Regarding the question of whether the patient's medical images are necessary, the answer is True. Images of the patient's skin lesions and mucous membrane erosions would be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris and in monitoring the response to treatment.",jama

The patient's generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash, along with pancytopenia, could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including drug reactions, systemic diseases, or malignancies. A skin biopsy would help to determine the exact cause of the rash and guide further management. 

Discontinuing trastuzumab is not the immediate next step without confirming that it is the cause of the rash. Prescribing topical steroids would be premature without a definitive diagnosis. Performing a screening test for syphilis could be considered, but it is less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",B,"Based on the patient's presentation of a generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash and pancytopenia, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a skin biopsy. This would help in determining the cause of the rash and pancytopenia, as there are several potential etiologies that could be contributing to these symptoms.

A skin biopsy would provide histopathological information that can aid in diagnosing the underlying cause of the rash. It can help differentiate between various dermatological conditions, such as drug reactions, infections, or malignancies. Additionally, the biopsy can also provide information about the presence of any specific skin manifestations related to the patient's breast cancer treatment.

Discontinuing trastuzumab may be considered if the rash is determined to be a drug reaction, but it would be premature to make this decision without further investigation.

Prescribing topical steroids may provide symptomatic relief for the rash, but it would not address the underlying cause. Therefore, it is important to determine the cause before initiating any specific treatment.

Performing a screening test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin) would be a reasonable consideration if there were clinical features suggestive of syphilis, such as a painless genital ulcer or other signs of secondary syphilis. However, based on the information provided, there are no indications to suggest syphilis as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Justification for the need for a medical image: False. The information provided in the question is sufficient to make a clinical decision without the need for a medical image.",B,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is: Obtain a skin biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient has developed a generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash, without fevers or other constitutional symptoms. This could be a sign of a skin reaction to the trastuzumab treatment. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Discontinuing trastuzumab without a confirmed diagnosis could be premature, and prescribing topical steroids without a confirmed diagnosis could be ineffective. Performing a screening test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin) is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence to suggest that the rash is due to syphilis.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Obtain a skin biopsy.

The patient's symptoms of a generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash, without fevers or other constitutional symptoms, and the physical examination findings of multiple red-brown plaques and papules on the chest, abdomen, back, and limbs, suggest a possible cutaneous adverse event related to trastuzumab therapy. The patient's history of invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast and treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by modified radical mastectomy, and adjuvant radiotherapy, increase the likelihood of a drug-related skin toxicity.

A skin biopsy would help to confirm the diagnosis of a cutaneous adverse event related to trastuzumab and guide further management. The biopsy results could also provide information on the severity of the skin toxicity and help to determine the appropriate course of action, such as holding or discontinuing trastuzumab therapy, and/or prescribing topical or systemic steroids.

Therefore, option 2: Obtain a skin biopsy, is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's care.

She denied any history of trauma and had not applied anything topically in this area of skin. She denied fevers, systemic symptoms, joint pain, and skin thickening. Her medications included metformin, lansoprazole, venlafaxine, diltiazem, atorvastatin, oxycodone/acetaminophen, ramopril, reglan, zolpidem, and clopidogrel. Physical examination revealed an 8-cm solitary, erythematous plaque with vesiculation and central erosion on the right lateral area of her abdomen (Figure, A). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. A punch biopsy showed a vacuolar interface dermatitis pattern, but a definitive clinical diagnosis was not established.

The patient's symptoms and the course of her disease suggest a possible case of shingles, which is caused by the varicella zoster virus. Shingles typically presents as a painful, vesicular rash on one side of the body, often in a band-like distribution. The patient's age and history of diabetes mellitus, which can affect the immune system, also make her more susceptible to shingles. The fact that the rash resolved with clobetasol, a topical corticosteroid, does not rule out shingles, as corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and pain associated with the rash. A skin swab for varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody level would help confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are less likely. The patient's symptoms do not suggest an autoimmune disease (which would be suggested by positive antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies), a recent procedure (which would be revealed by a detailed procedural history), or a contact allergen (which would be identified by patch testing).

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description of the rash and its location, along with the patient's history and the course of her disease, are sufficient to make a probable diagnosis.",B,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a detailed procedural history. This is important because the patient denies any trauma or topical application in the affected area, so it is necessary to investigate if any recent medical procedures or interventions could have caused the rash.

The other options listed are less likely to be the next step in this case. Ordering laboratory studies for antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies would be more relevant if there were suspicion of an autoimmune condition, which is not mentioned in the patient's history or presentation. Patch testing for a possible contact allergen would be considered if there was a suspicion of contact dermatitis, but again, there is no mention of any exposure or contact with potential allergens. Obtaining a skin swab for varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody level would be relevant if there were suspicion of herpes zoster (shingles), but there is no mention of characteristic symptoms such as pain or vesicles in a dermatomal distribution.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",C,The correct answer is: Perform patch testing for a possible contact allergen,B,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to Obtain a detailed procedural history.

The patient's history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, gastric ulcers, celiac artery occlusion, and transient ischemic attacks, along with the recent onset of a painful rash on her flank, suggests that she may have a history of systemic disease that could be related to the rash. Additionally, the patient's medication list includes several medications that could potentially cause a rash, such as lansoprazole, venlafaxine, and clopidogrel.

Therefore, it would be important to obtain a detailed procedural history to identify any potential triggers or contributing factors for the rash, such as recent changes in medication, new exposures, or any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the rash. This information can help guide further management and diagnostic testing.

Ordering laboratory studies for antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies may be appropriate if the patient had a history of autoimmune disease or if there were signs of systemic involvement, but this is not clearly indicated in the case presentation. Patch testing for a possible contact allergen may be appropriate if there were signs of allergic contact dermatitis, but this is not clearly indicated in the case presentation.

The patient's symptoms, including gait instability, vertigo, double vision, and unintentional weight loss, along with the findings of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and calcified pleural plaques on chest CT, suggest a possible paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare disorders triggered by an altered immune system response to a neoplasm. They are defined by the remote effects of cancer and are not caused by the tumor itself or its metastases. 

The patient's long history of smoking also increases the risk of lung cancer, which is commonly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. The elevated protein and lymphocyte predominant pleocytosis in the CSF, along with the presence of oligoclonal bands, further support this possibility. 

FDG-PET/CT scan can help identify the primary tumor site, and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation can confirm the diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of gait instability, frequent falls, vertigo, double vision, unintentional weight loss, and cranial nerve abnormalities raise concern for a paraneoplastic syndrome. The presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and calcified pleural plaques on imaging further support this suspicion. Therefore, obtaining a whole-body FDG-PET/CT scan can help identify any underlying malignancy that may be causing the paraneoplastic syndrome.

Additionally, performing a paraneoplastic antibody evaluation can help confirm the diagnosis. Paraneoplastic antibodies, such as anti-Hu, anti-Yo, and anti-Ri, are associated with specific malignancies and can aid in identifying the underlying tumor.

Obtaining evoked potentials or electromyography (EMG) would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and findings are more suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome rather than a peripheral neuropathy or neuromuscular disorder.

Checking thiamine levels and starting oral supplementation would not be indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with thiamine deficiency.

The patient's presentation of fatigue, splenomegaly, and a high white blood cell count with increased immature granulocytes suggests a myeloproliferative disorder, possibly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A bone marrow biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic test for such conditions, as it allows for the examination of the marrow's cellularity and the identification of any chromosomal abnormalities, such as the Philadelphia chromosome, which is associated with CML.

The other options are less appropriate. A heterophile antibody test is used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis, which is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of fever or lymphadenopathy. Starting chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin would be premature without a definitive diagnosis.

The other options listed are not appropriate at this stage:
- Ordering a heterophile antibody test is not indicated as the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are not suggestive of infectious mononucleosis.
- Starting cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy should not be done without confirming the diagnosis of AML through a bone marrow biopsy.

Results of a serum antinuclear antibody test were positive, with a titer of 1:640. Liver biopsy demonstrated moderately active interface and lobular hepatitis with plasma cells and periportal cholestasis, findings suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis.

The patient's symptoms, including fever and a macular rash involving the palms and soles, are suggestive of secondary syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted infection that can be more common and more aggressive in patients with HIV. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis. If the RPR test is positive, it should be confirmed with a more specific treponemal test.

Stopping atorvastatin is not the best next step because the patient's liver biopsy findings are more consistent with autoimmune hepatitis than with drug-induced liver injury. Continuing prednisone and azathioprine is not the best next step because the new symptoms (fever, rash) suggest a different diagnosis (secondary syphilis) that needs to be addressed. Biopsying the skin lesions is not the best next step because the clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of secondary syphilis, which can be confirmed with less invasive testing.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. The patient's presentation with fever and macular rash involving the palms and soles raises suspicion for syphilis, which can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, including hepatitis. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis and can help confirm or rule out this diagnosis.

Stopping atorvastatin secondary to statin-associated hepatitis is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's liver abnormalities are due to statin use. The patient's liver biopsy findings and positive antinuclear antibody test are more consistent with autoimmune hepatitis.

Continuing prednisone and azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis is a reasonable option, as the patient's liver biopsy findings are suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis. However, given the new onset of fever and rash, it is important to consider other potential causes, such as syphilis, before attributing these symptoms solely to autoimmune hepatitis.

Biopsying the skin lesions is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more suggestive of a systemic condition rather than a primary skin disorder.

2. Continue prednisone and azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis
3. Check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test
4. Biopsy the skin lesions

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate option would be to continue prednisone and azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis. The patient has been diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, and the treatment for this condition is immunosuppressive therapy, which includes prednisone and azathioprine. The development of a rash does not necessarily indicate a need to stop the treatment. 

Option 1, stopping atorvastatin, is not appropriate because there is no evidence to suggest that the rash is related to statin-associated hepatitis. 

Option 3, checking an RPR test, is not appropriate because there is no indication that the patient has syphilis or any other condition that would require an RPR test. 

Option 4, biopsying the skin lesions, is not appropriate because there is no evidence to suggest that the rash is related to a skin condition that would require a biopsy. 

Therefore, the correct answer is to continue prednisone and azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Continue prednisone and azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and malaise, along with the abnormal liver function test results, are consistent with autoimmune hepatitis. The positive serum antinuclear antibody test result and the liver biopsy findings of moderately active interface and lobular hepatitis with plasma cells and periportal cholestasis further support this diagnosis. The patient has already been started on prednisone and azathioprine, which are appropriate treatments for autoimmune hepatitis.

Therefore, it is not necessary to stop atorvastatin (option 1) or check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (option 3) at this time. Biopsying the skin lesions (option 4) may be unnecessary and potentially harmful, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the liver is the primary affected organ.

He is uncertain whether he has a family history of oral ulcers. He was previously prescribed anesthetic rinses and fluconazole, without benefit. His current medications include omeprazole and lorazepam. Intraoral examination demonstrates an ulcer with a pseudomembrane and erythematous halo on the left lateral surface of the tongue (Figure).

Prescribe amoxicillin (500 mg) 3 times daily for the next 7 days']",C,A,"The correct action to take next would be to ""Obtain a biopsy of the ulcer"". 

The patient's history of recurring oral ulcers that resolve and recur on different mucosal surfaces, along with the lack of response to anesthetic rinses and fluconazole, suggests a non-infectious cause. The ulcers are not associated with new medications, foods, or oral hygiene products, and there is no involvement of cutaneous or other mucosal surfaces. This makes a diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) likely. RAS is a common cause of recurrent oral ulcers and is diagnosed clinically. However, given the duration and the lack of response to previous treatments, a biopsy would be appropriate to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions such as oral cancer, especially in a patient of this age.

Prescribing valacyclovir or amoxicillin would not be appropriate without evidence of a viral or bacterial infection, respectively. A complete blood cell count with differential could be useful in diagnosing a systemic disease, but there is no indication of this from the patient's history or physical examination.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description of the ulcer and the patient's history provide sufficient information to make a decision. So, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a biopsy of the ulcer. This is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the recurring mouth ulcers. While there are several potential causes for mouth ulcers, including viral infections like herpes simplex virus (HSV), a biopsy would help rule out other possible causes such as autoimmune disorders or malignancies. It would also provide important information for further management and treatment.

Prescribing valacyclovir may be considered if there is a suspicion of HSV infection, but in this case, there is no mention of typical features of HSV infection, such as vesicles or prodromal symptoms. Therefore, it would be more prudent to investigate further with a biopsy before initiating antiviral therapy.

Ordering a complete blood cell count with differential may be useful in ruling out hematologic disorders, but it is less likely to be the cause of the recurring mouth ulcers in this patient. The history and clinical presentation do not strongly suggest a hematologic disorder as the underlying cause.

Prescribing amoxicillin would not be appropriate in this case, as there is no indication of an infectious etiology for the mouth ulcers. The patient's symptoms have been recurring for 2 years, and previous treatment with fluconazole did not provide any benefit, suggesting that a fungal infection is unlikely.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",A,"The correct answer is: Obtain a biopsy of the ulcer.

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent mouth ulcers that resolve within 2 weeks but recur on different mucosal surfaces, along with the absence of new medications, foods, or oral hygiene products, suggests the possibility of a systemic disorder such as Behçet's disease or aphthous stomatitis. The presence of an ulcer with a pseudomembrane and erythematous halo on the left lateral surface of the tongue further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, obtaining a biopsy of the ulcer is the most appropriate next step to aid in the diagnosis of the underlying condition. Prescribing valacyclovir, amoxicillin, or ordering a complete blood cell count with differential may be appropriate in certain clinical scenarios, but they are not supported by the information provided in the question.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Prescribe valacyclovir (1000 mg) 3 times daily for the next 7 days.

The patient's history of recurring mouth ulcers, which resolve within 2 weeks but recur on different mucosal surfaces, suggests a diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). This condition is characterized by the formation of painful ulcers on the mucous membranes of the mouth, which can be triggered by various factors such as stress, hormonal changes, or certain foods. The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and anxiety may also be contributing factors.

Valacyclovir, an antiviral medication, is commonly used to treat RAS. It works by reducing the severity and duration of the ulcers, and can also help to prevent recurrences. The recommended dosage is typically 1000 mg taken 3 times daily for 7-10 days.

While obtaining a biopsy of the ulcer (option 1) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with RAS, and valacyclovir is a safe and effective treatment option.

Ordering a complete blood cell count with differential (option 3) may be necessary to rule out other conditions that may be causing the ulcers, such as a hematologic disorder, but it is not the most urgent step in this case.

The patient's symptoms of iris color change and eyelash growth on the right side are likely related to her use of bimatoprost, a prostaglandin analog used in the treatment of glaucoma. These are known side effects of the medication. However, given the patient's age and medical history, it would be prudent to rule out other potential causes of these symptoms, such as iris melanoma. A slit-lamp and dilated examination by an ophthalmologist would allow for a more detailed assessment of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, which is necessary in this case.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description provided is sufficient for a medical professional to make an informed decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",D,"I would choose the answer: Refer to an ophthalmologist urgently for slit-lamp and dilated examination.

The patient's symptoms of longer, thicker eyelashes on the right side compared to the left, along with a gradual darkening of the right iris, raise concerns for a possible ocular condition. Given the patient's history of open-angle glaucoma and the changes observed in the iris and eyelashes, it is important to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for a thorough examination.

This examination should include a slit-lamp examination, which allows for a detailed evaluation of the structures of the eye, including the iris and eyelashes. Additionally, a dilated examination would be necessary to assess the internal structures of the eye, such as the retina and optic nerve.

The other options, such as performing eye and orbit computed tomography or ordering serologic studies, may be considered depending on the findings of the ophthalmologist's examination. However, the immediate next step should be to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.

The patient is presenting with symptoms that could indicate a potential issue with her eyes, such as uneven eyelash growth and a change in iris color. Given the patient's medical history, including a previous diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma, it is important to refer her to an ophthalmologist for a thorough examination.

Justification:
The question requires a medical professional's input as it relates to a patient's health. Specifically, an ophthalmologist's expertise is needed to address the eye-related concerns presented in the case. A slit-lamp and dilated examination can help identify any potential issues and inform the appropriate course of action.",D,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist urgently for a slit-lamp and dilated examination. The patient's symptoms of longer, thicker eyelashes on the right side and a change in iris color are concerning signs of a potential eye disorder, and a thorough examination by an ophthalmologist is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

The option to perform an eye and orbit computed tomography (CT) scan may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While a CT scan can provide valuable information about the eye and surrounding tissues, it may not be able to capture the subtle changes in the iris and eyelashes that the patient is experiencing. Additionally, a CT scan may not be necessary at this stage, and it may be more appropriate to first consult with an ophthalmologist to determine the appropriate course of action.

The option to order serologic studies, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody titers, complete blood cell count, and basic chemistry panel, may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While these tests can help rule out certain systemic conditions that may be affecting the eye, they may not provide direct information about the patient's eye disorder.

Reassuring the patient without further evaluation and treatment may not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms suggest a potential eye disorder that requires prompt attention.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist urgently for a slit-lamp and dilated examination to evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the appropriate course of treatment.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275423,A 15-year-old obese girl presented to clinic with increasing right shin pain of 4 weeks’ duration. The pain began after the patient began to play competitive basketball and was localized to her mid shin. Dietary and menstrual histories revealed no abnormalities. Examination demonstrated focal tenderness along the distal mid shaft of the tibia anteriorly. The single-leg hop test elicited severe localized pain. Radiographs were obtained for further evaluation (Figure).,What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Obtain laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities', 'B. Refer for immediate surgery', 'C. Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity', 'D. Order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)']",C,C,"Based on the information provided, I would choose to ""Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity"". 

The patient's symptoms and the fact that they began after she started playing competitive basketball suggest that she may be suffering from a stress fracture. Stress fractures are common in athletes and are often caused by overuse or repetitive activity. They can cause severe pain, especially during weight-bearing activities. 

The best initial treatment for a stress fracture is rest and immobilization. This allows the bone to heal and prevents further injury. Non-weight-bearing activities, such as swimming or cycling, may be recommended to maintain fitness levels while the fracture heals. 

The other options are less likely based on the information provided. There's no indication of nutritional or hormonal abnormalities from the patient's history, and immediate surgery is typically reserved for more severe fractures. NSAIDs can help manage pain, but they won't address the underlying issue.

As for the need for a medical image, the answer is <True>. The radiographs that were obtained for further evaluation would be crucial in confirming the diagnosis of a stress fracture.",D,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 

The patient's history and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of shin splints, which is a common overuse injury seen in athletes, particularly those involved in activities that involve repetitive impact on the lower extremities, such as running or jumping. The focal tenderness along the distal mid shaft of the tibia and severe localized pain on the single-leg hop test are consistent with this diagnosis.

Laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities would not be necessary in this case, as the patient's dietary and menstrual histories revealed no abnormalities. Additionally, shin splints are typically a result of mechanical stress rather than nutritional or hormonal factors.

Immediate surgery would not be indicated for shin splints, as they are a self-limiting condition that can be managed conservatively with rest, activity modification, and pain management.

Immobilization with non-weight-bearing activity may be considered in more severe cases or if conservative measures fail, but it is not the initial step in management.

Justification: Shin splints, or medial tibial stress syndrome, is a common overuse injury seen in athletes. The patient's history of increasing right shin pain after starting competitive basketball, along with the focal tenderness and severe localized pain on examination, are consistent with this diagnosis. The initial management of shin splints involves observation, activity modification, and pain management with NSAIDs. This approach allows for symptom relief and gradual return to activity while avoiding unnecessary interventions.

Medical image: False. The question does not require a corresponding medical image.",C,"Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity

The patient presents with symptoms of shin pain that is aggravated by physical activity, and the physical examination reveals focal tenderness along the distal mid shaft of the tibia. The most appropriate next step would be to order immobilization with non-weight-bearing activity to prevent further stress on the tibia and allow it to heal. This conservative approach is often effective in treating shin pain, especially if it is related to sports or overuse. Surgery is not necessary at this stage, and there is no indication for laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities. Observation and pain management with NSAIDs may be a part of the treatment plan, but immobilization should be the first step to prevent further damage.",D,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The patient's symptoms of localized pain in the mid shin, tenderness to palpation, and positive single-leg hop test suggest a likely diagnosis of a tibial stress injury, also known as shin splints. This is a common overuse injury in runners and athletes, especially in those who have recently increased their level of physical activity, as in this patient's case.

Therefore, it is not necessary to obtain laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities, as this is unlikely to be related to the patient's symptoms. Similarly, immediate surgery is not indicated, as shin splints typically respond well to conservative management.

Immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While it may help to reduce pain and allow for healing, it may also lead to decreased muscle strength and flexibility, which could prolong the patient's recovery.

Observation and pain management with NSAIDs, on the other hand, would allow the patient to continue to participate in low-impact activities while managing their pain and inflammation. This approach would also allow for close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and progression, and would enable adjustments to be made to the treatment plan as needed.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Justify:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a tibial stress injury, which is a common overuse injury in runners and athletes. Conservative management, including observation and pain management with NSAIDs, is a well-established and effective treatment approach for this condition.

Medical image:

True. A medical image, such as an X-ray or MRI, may be helpful in ruling out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stress fracture or soft tissue injury.

Start a high-potency topical steroid']",C,C,"The correct answer is: Obtain antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers.

The patient's presentation of bronchiectasis of unknown etiology, combined with a new skin rash and worsening respiratory symptoms, is suggestive of a systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis). GPA is a small-vessel vasculitis that often presents with upper and lower respiratory tract disease and renal involvement. Skin involvement, such as purpura, nodules, ulcers, and vesicles, occurs in about half of patients. The diagnosis is often confirmed by the presence of c-ANCA or PR3-ANCA, hence the need to obtain ANCA titers.

The other options are less likely. Blood cultures and empirical treatment with vancomycin would be appropriate for suspected sepsis or severe skin infection, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with these conditions. Herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus testing and treatment would be appropriate for suspected viral skin infection, but again, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this. A high-potency topical steroid would be used for a localized skin condition, but the patient's systemic symptoms suggest a systemic disease.

ANCA testing can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Obtaining blood cultures and empirically treating with intravenous vancomycin would be more appropriate if there were signs of systemic infection, such as fever or sepsis, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

Performing a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treating with valacyclovir would be more relevant if there were vesicular lesions or a history of recent exposure to herpes simplex or varicella zoster virus, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Starting a high-potency topical steroid would not be the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest a primary dermatological condition that would require topical treatment.

Justification for the need for a medical image: False. The information provided in the question does not indicate a need for a medical image.",D,"Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most appropriate next step would be to start a high-potency topical steroid.

Blood cultures would help to confirm the presence of a bacterial infection and guide antibiotic treatment. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin would be appropriate while awaiting blood culture results, as it is effective against a wide range of bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Performing a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treating with valacyclovir may be appropriate if the patient had a history of herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus infection, but there is no mention of this in the patient's history.

Recently, extensive skin disease and pruritus developed. He noted 20 years of chronic diarrhea, which improved with a gluten-free diet, in addition to chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and aortic stenosis. Physical examination revealed diffuse erosions with grouped papules and vesicles on his bilateral extremities, elbow and knee extensors, chest, back, buttocks, face, and scalp (Figure 1).

The patient's history of dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic diarrhea that improved with a gluten-free diet, and the description of his current skin condition all point towards a possible flare-up of dermatitis herpetiformis. This condition is a chronic, intensely itchy, blistering skin manifestation of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, commonly known as celiac disease. The best way to confirm this diagnosis would be through a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. 

A skin biopsy can reveal the characteristic findings of dermatitis herpetiformis, which include neutrophils and eosinophils at the tips of dermal papillae. Direct immunofluorescence can detect IgA deposits in a granular pattern in the same location, which is virtually diagnostic of dermatitis herpetiformis.

The other options are less likely to be helpful in this situation. Scabies infestation is less likely given the patient's history and the widespread nature of his skin lesions. A complete blood cell count and creatinine level could be useful in assessing the patient's overall health and kidney function, but they would not directly help in diagnosing his skin condition. A chest radiograph would not be useful unless there was a suspicion of a lung condition, which is not indicated in this case.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the patient's history and description of his skin condition are sufficient to make a probable diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. This would help confirm the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis and differentiate it from other skin conditions with similar presentations. Skin biopsy can reveal characteristic findings such as neutrophilic microabscesses in the dermal papillae and direct immunofluorescence can show granular deposition of IgA in the dermal papillae.

Examining for infestation with scabies may be considered if there are specific clinical features suggestive of scabies, such as burrows or intense itching in certain areas. However, the extensive skin disease and chronicity of symptoms in this patient make dermatitis herpetiformis a more likely diagnosis.

Obtaining a complete blood cell count and creatinine level would be important to assess the patient's overall health and renal function, but it may not provide specific information regarding the skin eruption.

Obtaining a chest radiograph would not be necessary in this case as there are no indications or symptoms suggestive of respiratory involvement.

This question does not require the corresponding medical image.",C,The correct answer is: Perform skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence,A,"Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most appropriate next step would be to examine for infestation with scabies.

The patient's symptoms of intractable pruritus, skin eruption, and extensive excoriations, as well as the physical examination findings of grouped papules and vesicles, honey-colored crusts, and possible burrows on the wrists, are all consistent with a diagnosis of scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious parasitic infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which burrows into the skin and lays eggs, leading to intense itching and skin irritation.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a scabies examination, which involves inspecting the skin for signs of the mite, such as burrows, eggs, or live mites. This can be done using a magnifying glass or a dermatoscope. If scabies is confirmed, appropriate treatment, such as topical permethrin or oral ivermectin, would be initiated.

It is important to note that the patient's history of chronic diarrhea, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and aortic stenosis may also need to be addressed, but the immediate concern is the scabies infestation.

The patient's age, the widespread distribution of the lesions, and the presence of oral lesions suggest a systemic cause rather than a localized skin condition. The lesions have been present for 4 months, which is a relatively long duration for ecchymoses, even in a patient on anticoagulation. The fact that the lesions have not resolved despite multiple consultations with specialists also raises suspicion for a more serious underlying condition. 

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can help identify any internal abnormalities such as tumors or enlarged lymph nodes that could be causing the skin and oral lesions. This could potentially indicate a malignancy such as lymphoma or leukemia, which can present with skin and oral lesions. 

The other options are less likely. Topical steroids and photodynamic therapy are treatments for localized skin conditions, which this does not appear to be. An HIV test could be considered if the patient had risk factors for HIV, but there is no information suggesting this in the case description.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image. The description of the lesions and their distribution is sufficient to suggest a systemic cause. However, images could potentially provide more information about the specific characteristics of the lesions. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",D,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to order a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test. The patient's presentation of multiple dark skin lesions on various parts of the body, including the mouth, raises concern for Kaposi sarcoma, which is commonly associated with HIV infection. Additionally, the fact that the patient is of British descent and has a history of atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin does not explain the presence of these lesions. Therefore, ruling out HIV infection is crucial in this case.

Justification for choosing an HIV test:
- Kaposi sarcoma is commonly associated with HIV infection, especially in older individuals.
- The patient's presentation of multiple dark skin lesions on various parts of the body, including the mouth, is consistent with Kaposi sarcoma.
- The patient's medical history and current treatment with warfarin do not explain the presence of these lesions.
- HIV infection should be ruled out as it can have significant implications for the patient's overall health and treatment plan.

Justification for not choosing the other options:
- Initiating empirical treatment with a topical steroid may provide temporary relief for certain skin conditions, but it does not address the underlying cause of the lesions in this case.
- Initiating photodynamic therapy is not appropriate without a confirmed diagnosis and understanding of the underlying cause of the lesions.
- Ordering computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be considered later in the diagnostic workup, but it is not the most immediate step given the patient's presentation and history.
- The patient's symptoms and clinical findings do not suggest a need for computed tomography imaging at this stage.

Justification for not needing a medical image:
- Based on the information provided, a medical image is not necessary to make the initial decision of ordering an HIV test. The decision is based on the patient's clinical presentation and history.",D,"Based on the given information, the patient has multiple dark skin lesions on his neck, chest, abdomen, and upper extremities, as well as dark red lesions in his mouth. The patient is also taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation. The specialists he has seen have diagnosed the lesions as ecchymoses secondary to warfarin anticoagulation. 

Given this information, it is not appropriate to initiate empirical treatment with a topical steroid or initiate photodynamic therapy without further investigation. Therefore, the correct answer is to order a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test. 

The reason for this is that the patient's symptoms could be indicative of an HIV-related disease, such as Kaposi sarcoma. It is important to rule out this possibility before initiating any treatment. 

Additionally, the question does not mention any need for computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, so this option is not appropriate. 

In summary, based on the given information, the correct answer is to order a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test.",D,"As a professional doctor, I would choose option 4, Order a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test.

The patient's symptoms of multiple dark skin lesions on the neck, chest, abdomen, and upper extremities, as well as dark red lesions in the mouth, are consistent with the symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that affects the skin and lymphatic system. Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a viral infection, specifically Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). HHV-8 is a virus that is commonly found in people with HIV.

Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, it is possible that the lesions are ecchymoses secondary to warfarin anticoagulation, as suggested by the patient's primary care physician and specialists. However, the presence of multiple lesions on the skin and in the mouth, as well as the patient's age and medical history, make it important to consider the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Therefore, I would order an HIV test to determine whether the patient has been infected with HIV, which could help to confirm the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. If the HIV test is positive, further testing would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Justification for the answer:

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma, which is caused by HHV-8 and is commonly found in people with HIV. Ordering an HIV test would help to determine whether the patient has been infected with HIV, which could help to confirm the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Image justification:

Computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (option 3) may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as lymphoma or other cancers.

The patient's symptoms of gingival peeling, pain, bleeding, and white patches on the oral mucosa, along with the presence of Wickham striae, are suggestive of a condition called lichen planus. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. The oral variant, oral lichen planus, often presents with white striae (Wickham striae) and can cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and difficulty brushing teeth. 

While the exact cause of lichen planus is unknown, it is not caused by a viral infection, so prescribing valacyclovir would not be appropriate. Similarly, there is no indication that the patient has a vitamin B3 deficiency, so ordering a nutritional assay would not be necessary. Using an alcohol-based mouthwash could actually exacerbate the patient's symptoms, as alcohol can be irritating to the oral mucosa.

A biopsy of the affected tissue is the best way to confirm a diagnosis of lichen planus. The biopsy would allow for histopathological examination of the tissue, which can help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the oral mucosa and can cause pain, bleeding, and ulceration. It is associated with a T-cell-mediated immune response and can be triggered by various factors, including stress, infection, and genetic predisposition.

Valacyclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily) may be effective in treating oral herpes simplex virus infections, but it is not appropriate for the management of oral lichen planus.

A nutritional assay to evaluate for vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency may be useful in the management of pellagra, a condition characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia, but it is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms.

Increased use of an alcohol-based mouthwash may help improve oral hygiene, but it is not a definitive treatment for oral lichen planus.

Therefore, the best answer is:

Biopsy the affected tissue.

Justification:
A biopsy is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis of oral lichen planus and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and seasonal allergies may also need to be taken into consideration during the diagnostic process, but they do not obviate the need for a biopsy.

The patient's history of travel to a tropical region, specifically the rainforests of Venezuela, and the presence of non-responsive skin lesions suggest a possible tropical infectious disease. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies and is common in tropical and subtropical regions. It often presents as skin lesions that do not respond to common antibiotics, as seen in this case. Therefore, testing for leishmaniasis would be a logical next step.

The other options are less likely. Immunofluorescence of biopsied tissue could be useful in certain dermatological conditions, but given the patient's history and symptoms, it is less likely to provide a diagnosis. A biopsy with oncology consultation would be more appropriate if there was a suspicion of cancer, which is not indicated here. Prescribing intravenous vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection would be premature without evidence of such an infection.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the Leishmania species, which is transmitted through the bite of infected sandflies. The patient's history of travel to the rainforests of Salto Ángel, Venezuela, raises suspicion for leishmaniasis as a possible cause of the skin lesions.

The patient has already been seen by multiple clinicians and has received various antibiotic treatments, none of which have been effective. This suggests that the underlying cause of the skin lesions may not be bacterial in nature, but rather a parasitic infection such as leishmaniasis.

Performing leishmaniasis PCR testing of the biopsied tissue can help confirm the diagnosis by detecting the presence of Leishmania DNA. This would provide valuable information for appropriate treatment and management of the patient's condition.

In this case, obtaining immunofluorescence of the biopsied tissue or performing a biopsy with oncology consultation would not be the most appropriate next steps, as there is no indication of a potential malignancy based on the information provided.

Prescribing intravenous vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection would also not be appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has an MRSA infection.

His myelofibrosis had been treated 2 years earlier with a splenectomy and allogeneic peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a single-antigen mismatched unrelated donor. A busulfan-based myeloablative regimen was used for preconditioning before the transplant.

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible case of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is a common complication following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The symptoms of chronic GVHD can mimic autoimmune or collagen vascular diseases, and can affect the skin, causing rashes similar to the one described. The patient's history of acute GVHD also increases his risk for developing chronic GVHD. 

A skin punch biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing skin involvement in chronic GVHD. The other options listed, such as ordering antibody tests or starting treatment, would not be appropriate without first confirming the diagnosis. 

The question does not need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, so the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most appropriate next step would be to order anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and antihistone antibody tests. 

The patient's symptoms, including the nonpruritic rash, intermittent fever, muscle pain, and weakness, are suggestive of a drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) reaction. DILE is a known complication of certain medications, including tacrolimus, which the patient had been taking. The presence of anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and antihistone antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis of DILE.

A skin punch biopsy may be considered if the antibody tests are inconclusive or if there is a need to rule out other potential causes of the rash. However, it is not the initial step in the evaluation of this patient.

Starting high-potency topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or both may be appropriate for certain types of skin rashes, but in this case, systemic immunosuppressive therapy would be more appropriate given the patient's symptoms and history of graft-vs-host disease.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, and the blood test results showing high white blood cell count with a lymphocytic predominance and presence of smudge cells are suggestive of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Smudge cells are often seen in CLL and are a result of the fragility of the cancerous lymphocytes.

Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood sample is the next appropriate step in the evaluation of this patient. This test can help confirm the diagnosis by identifying a clonal population of B cells (which are a type of lymphocyte) that express certain markers characteristic of CLL.

An excisional lymph node biopsy is not necessary at this point as the blood tests are more indicative of a blood disorder rather than a localized lymph node disease. A mononucleosis test is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms and blood test results do not suggest this condition. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen with contrast could be useful in staging the disease if CLL is confirmed, but it is not the next step in diagnosis.

Flow cytometry is a diagnostic test that can help confirm the diagnosis of CLL by identifying the characteristic immunophenotypic markers on the abnormal lymphocytes.

An excisional lymph node biopsy may be considered if there is significant lymphadenopathy or if the flow cytometry results are inconclusive. However, since the patient's lymph nodes were not enlarged on examination, it would not be the most appropriate initial step.

Requesting computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen with contrast may be useful to evaluate for lymphadenopathy or organ involvement in CLL. However, given the absence of lymphadenopathy on physical examination, it would not be the most appropriate initial step.

An mononucleosis test is not indicated in this case as the patient does not have symptoms suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, such as fever, pharyngitis, or lymphadenopathy.

D) Prescribe oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy

Answer: A) Check serum cryoglobulin level

Explanation:

The patient's history of recurrent membranous nephropathy and recent diagnosis of lupus nephritis Class IV suggests that she may have kidney damage caused by deposition of immune complexes. Cryoglobulins are proteins that precipitate at low temperatures and can form immune complexes that deposit in the kidneys, leading to membranous nephropathy. Checking the serum cryoglobulin level can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment decisions.

Justification for medical image: True

Administering intradermal progesterone challenge (B) may be useful in diagnosing and managing certain autoimmune disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis. Prescribing interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir (C) is typically used to treat hepatitis C infection, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

The patient's history of polycythemia vera and the recent onset of left upper quadrant pain, along with the known presence of a splenic hemangioma, suggest that the spleen may be the source of the patient's discomfort. Polycythemia vera is a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells, which can lead to an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). Splenic hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can also cause splenomegaly. If the spleen becomes too large, it can cause discomfort and potentially rupture, which would be a medical emergency.

Conservative management with transfusions, fluids, and analgesics would not address the underlying issue of the enlarged spleen. A bone marrow biopsy would not be necessary in this case, as the patient's polycythemia vera is already known and managed. An urgent upper endoscopy would not be appropriate as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of an upper gastrointestinal source.

Therefore, a surgical consultation for splenectomy would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the feasibility and risks of removing the spleen to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent potential complications.

His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. His pupils were round and reactive with no afferent pupillary defect. His intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 13 mm Hg in the left. Extraocular movements were normal in both eyes. Slit lamp examination of the anterior segment of the right eye was unrevealing. Figure 1 shows the left eye. The anterior chamber, iris, and lens of the left eye were normal. Dilated fundus examination of both eyes was unremarkable.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Prescribe topical interferon drops', 'B. Prescribe topical interferon drops followed by excisional biopsy', 'C. Perform excisional biopsy', 'D. Recommend enucleation']",C,C,"The correct next step would be to ""Perform excisional biopsy"". 

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible ocular surface neoplasm, such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). OSSN is a spectrum of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions of the conjunctiva and cornea, and it is more common in regions near the equator, like Nigeria. The patient's history of ocular surface surgery could have been an attempt to remove a pterygium, which is a risk factor for OSSN. 

The rapid growth, inability to close the eye, and redness and pain are concerning for a malignant process. Therefore, an excisional biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment. 

Topical interferon drops could be used as a treatment for OSSN, but without a confirmed diagnosis, it would be inappropriate to start treatment. Enucleation, or removal of the eye, is a drastic measure that would only be considered if the tumor was very large or invasive, which does not seem to be the case here.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description and history provided are sufficient to make a decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an excisional biopsy. The patient's history of a progressively enlarging, red, and painful mass in the left eye, along with the inability to close the eye, raises concern for a malignant tumor. The fact that the patient had previous ocular surface surgery for a pterygium, but does not know the details, further supports the need for a biopsy to determine the nature of the mass.

Prescribing topical interferon drops alone would not be sufficient in this case, as it is important to establish a definitive diagnosis through biopsy before initiating any specific treatment. Topical interferon drops may be considered as an adjunctive treatment after the biopsy results are obtained.

Enucleation, which involves the removal of the entire eye, would be a more radical approach and is typically reserved for cases where there is extensive invasion or spread of a malignant tumor. Without further information or evidence of such involvement, enucleation would not be the first-line option.

Justification for the need for a corresponding medical image: True. A medical image, such as a photograph or histopathological image, would be helpful in visualizing the left eye mass and confirming the need for an excisional biopsy.",C,"I would recommend performing an excisional biopsy. The patient has a suspicious mass in his left eye that has been progressively enlarging and becoming more red and painful. The mass is also interfering with his ability to close his eye. Given the unknown nature of the mass and the patient's history of ocular surface surgery in Nigeria, it is important to obtain a tissue sample for pathological evaluation. Topical interferon drops may have some efficacy in treating certain types of ocular surface tumors, but without a definitive diagnosis, it would be premature to prescribe them. Enucleation would be an extreme measure that would only be considered if the tumor were shown to be malignant and threatening the patient's life.",C,"Based on the information provided, I would recommend performing an excisional biopsy.

The patient's symptoms of a progressively enlarging mass in the left eye, accompanied by redness and pain, suggest a possible diagnosis of a conjunctival tumor. The fact that the patient has a history of ocular surface surgery in Nigeria, which he does not remember, increases the likelihood of a conjunctival tumor. The absence of any other medical history or symptoms also supports this diagnosis.

An excisional biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the tumor. This procedure involves removing a portion of the affected tissue and examining it under a microscope for cancerous cells.

Prescribing topical interferon drops or performing enucleation without further evaluation would not be appropriate at this stage. Topical interferon drops are typically used to treat viral conjunctivitis, and enucleation is a more invasive procedure that involves removing the entire eye.

Therefore, the answer is:

B. Perform excisional biopsy

Justification for medical image:

A medical image would be helpful in this case to provide a clearer view of the mass in the left eye. An image would allow for a more accurate assessment of the size, shape, and location of the mass, which would aid in the diagnosis and treatment plan. Therefore, the answer is:

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1866071,"A healthy 4-year-old girl presents to the ophthalmologist for evaluation of a white pupil (Figure 1). The parents had noted a white pupillary reflection in the left eye for the past 2 months. On ophthalmologic examination, the visual acuity of the right eye was 6/7.5 (equivalent to 20/25) and the left eye did not follow an object. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. There was no family history of childhood cancers, and the patient did not have any other pertinent or contributory medical history.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia)', 'B. Reassure parents and follow up in 3 months', 'C. Obtain serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis', 'D. Start urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis']",A,A,"The correct action to take next would be to ""Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia)"".

The white pupillary reflection, also known as leukocoria, in a child's eye is a serious sign that requires immediate evaluation. It can be associated with several conditions, including retinoblastoma (a malignant tumor of the retina), congenital cataract, or retinopathy of prematurity. The fact that the child's left eye did not follow an object suggests a significant visual impairment, which further supports the need for immediate evaluation.

A funduscopic examination is a procedure that allows the doctor to view the back of the eye, including the retina, optic disc, and the underlying layer of blood vessels. It is the most appropriate next step in this case to identify the cause of the leukocoria and visual impairment. The procedure would need to be performed under anesthesia due to the child's age and to ensure a thorough examination.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Reassuring the parents and following up in 3 months could delay necessary treatment for a potentially serious condition. Obtaining a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis is not indicated as there is no mention of exposure to dogs or symptoms of toxocariasis. Starting urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis is not appropriate as there is no evidence of inflammation in the eye.

The question does not necessarily need a corresponding medical image to be answered correctly, as the description provided is sufficient to make a decision. Therefore, the answer is <False>.",A,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a funduscopic examination under anesthesia. This is necessary to further evaluate the cause of the white pupil and determine the underlying pathology. The fact that the left eye does not follow an object suggests a potential vision impairment, which needs to be investigated. A funduscopic examination will allow for a detailed examination of the retina and optic nerve, which can help identify any abnormalities or potential causes for the white pupil.

Obtaining a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis would be a consideration if there were a suspicion of ocular toxocariasis, which is caused by a parasitic infection. However, there is no mention of any symptoms or risk factors associated with this condition in the given information.

Starting urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis would be premature without a confirmed diagnosis. Uveitis is inflammation of the uvea, which can cause a white pupil. However, it is important to establish the underlying cause before initiating any specific treatment.

Reassuring the parents and following up in 3 months would not be appropriate in this case, as the presence of a white pupil and lack of visual tracking in the left eye indicate a potential vision-threatening condition that requires immediate evaluation.

This question does not require a corresponding medical image.",A,"Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia)

The correct answer is to perform a funduscopic examination (under anesthesia). This is because the patient is presenting with a white pupil, which could be indicative of a serious underlying condition such as retinoblastoma. The funduscopic examination will allow the ophthalmologist to evaluate the retina and determine the cause of the abnormality. It is important to perform this examination as soon as possible to ensure early detection and treatment of any potential issues.

The other options are not appropriate in this situation. Reassuring the parents and following up in 3 months would not be sufficient given the potential seriousness of the condition. Obtaining a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Starting urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis would not be appropriate without first determining the underlying cause of the symptoms.

In this case, a funduscopic examination is necessary to evaluate the retina and determine the cause of the abnormality.",A,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a funduscopic examination (under anesthesia).

The patient's symptoms of a white pupillary reflection in the left eye, along with the absence of visual acuity in the left eye, suggest the possibility of a retinal abnormality. A funduscopic examination would allow the ophthalmologist to visualize the retina and determine the cause of the abnormality.

The other options do not seem appropriate at this time. Reassuring the parents and following up in 3 months without further evaluation may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Obtaining a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis may be relevant if the patient had a history of exposure to cat feces or soil, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the information provided. Starting urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis may be necessary at some point, but it is premature without first performing a funduscopic examination to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is (a) Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia).

Justify:
The question does not explicitly state that a medical image is required, but based on the symptoms described, it is likely that a funduscopic examination would be necessary to evaluate the retina and determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the answer is <True>.",jama

The child was found unconscious, and the cause is not yet known. It's crucial to monitor his vital signs, including heart rate and rhythm, to detect any abnormalities that might indicate a cardiac event, such as arrhythmia, which could have caused the loss of consciousness. 

The other options are less relevant given the information provided. There's no indication of a leg injury that would necessitate imaging, no signs of infection that would require antibiotics, and no suggestion of drug use that would warrant a drug screen.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to order observation and cardiac monitoring for the 8-year-old boy. 

The patient was found unconscious, which is a concerning symptom that requires immediate evaluation. Observation and cardiac monitoring will help assess the patient's vital signs, heart rhythm, and overall stability. This will provide crucial information to guide further management and determine the underlying cause of the unconsciousness.

None of the other options (obtaining imaging of the left leg, ordering intravenous antibiotics, or performing an extended drug screen) are indicated based on the information provided. There is no mention of any specific leg injury or infection, and there are no indications of drug intoxication or overdose. Therefore, these options are not relevant to the current presentation.

Regarding the need for medical imaging, based on the information provided, there is no indication for obtaining imaging of the left leg. Therefore, the answer is False.",C,"Order observation and cardiac monitoring. 

The patient is presenting with symptoms of being unconscious, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as a seizure, heart condition, or head injury. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac activity to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. Imaging of the left leg or an extended drug screen may not be necessary at this time, as there is no indication of trauma or drug use in the patient's history. Antibiotics may be necessary if an infection is suspected, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history either.",C,"Based on the information provided, the best course of action would be to order observation and cardiac monitoring. The patient's sudden loss of consciousness, especially on a rainy day, suggests that there may be a possibility of a cardiovascular or neurological issue.

Past medical history and family history are unrevealing.",What Would You Do Next?,"['A. Reassure patient that this is benign nail pigmentation', 'B. Recommend punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate', 'C. Recommend removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment', 'D. Send clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture.']",C,C,"The correct answer is: Recommend removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment.

The patient's presentation is concerning for subungual melanoma, a type of skin cancer that occurs under the nail. Subungual melanoma often presents as a pigmented band on the nail plate that widens over time, as described by the patient. The spread of pigment to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin, known as Hutchinson sign, is particularly concerning for malignancy. 

While a punch biopsy could provide some information, it may not capture the full extent of the disease due to the localized nature of the procedure. Sending clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture is typically more useful for diagnosing fungal infections rather than melanoma. Therefore, removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment is the most appropriate next step to ensure a definitive diagnosis.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image to be answered correctly. The description provided in the question is sufficient to make a decision. So, the answer is <False>.",C,"Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to recommend removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment. This is because the patient's history of a black streak down the middle of the nail that has widened and darkened over time, along with the spread of pigment to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin, raises concern for subungual melanoma. Subungual melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can present with pigmentation of the nail and surrounding skin. It is important to obtain a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

The question does not require a corresponding medical image.",B,"The correct answer is: Recommend punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of subungual and acral pigmentation of the left middle finger, with no associated symptoms of nail splitting, bleeding, or pain, and no history of acute or recurrent trauma, are suggestive of a benign condition called melanonychia. However, it is important to rule out any underlying malignancy, such as melanoma, which can present with similar symptoms. A punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate is a safe and effective method to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological examination. Removal of the entire nail plate may not be necessary and can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the patient. Sending clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture may not provide a sufficient tissue sample for diagnosis. Therefore, recommending a punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate is the most appropriate next step in this case.",B,"Based on the information provided, I would recommend option 2: Recommend punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of melanonychia, a common benign condition characterized by pigmentation of the nail bed. However, it's important to note that melanonychia can sometimes be a sign of an underlying melanoma, especially if the pigmentation is expanding or changing. Therefore, it's important to perform a biopsy to rule out any malignancy.

A punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate would allow for a diagnostic sample to be obtained while minimizing the risk of nail damage or infection. This procedure involves using a small tool to remove a cylindrical sample of tissue from the nail bed, which can then be sent for histopathological examination.

Option 1, reassuring the patient that the pigmentation is benign without performing a biopsy, may not be appropriate given the patient's history and the presence of acral pigmentation. Option 3, removing the entire nail plate, may be unnecessary and could potentially cause more harm to the patient. Option 4, sending clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture, may not provide sufficient tissue for diagnostic purposes.

His physician had prescribed a combination cream of betamethasone diproprionate and clotrimazole for these lesions. The patient reported no fevers or chills. He had no history of eczema and had not used any special wipes or cleansing agents in the perianal area.

Obtain fungal culture from both affected areas and initiate systemic antifungal therapy.']",B,A,"The correct answer is: Obtain a skin biopsy of the affected area on the left shin and apply a topical antibiotic to both the perianal area and the shin area until the pathology result is available.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible skin infection, which could be bacterial, fungal, or viral in nature. Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to his multiple sclerosis treatment with rituximab, it is important to accurately identify the causative agent to guide appropriate treatment. A skin biopsy will provide the most definitive diagnosis, as it can identify bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, as well as non-infectious causes of skin lesions. Topical antibiotics can be used as a preliminary treatment to potentially reduce the severity of the infection while waiting for the biopsy results.

The question does not need the corresponding medical image, so the answer is <False>. The patient's symptoms and history provide sufficient information to make a preliminary diagnosis and treatment plan. However, a medical image could potentially provide additional useful information, such as the exact location, size, and appearance of the skin lesions.",A,"Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a skin biopsy of the affected area on the left shin and apply a topical antibiotic to both the perianal area and the shin area until the pathology result is available.

The patient's symptoms, including the tender skin eruptions adjacent to the anus and on the left shin, along with the development of a central scab, suggest a possible infection. Obtaining a skin biopsy would help determine the underlying cause of the skin lesions and guide appropriate treatment.

While obtaining bacterial and fungal cultures may also be considered, initiating systemic antibiotic and antifungal therapy without a confirmed diagnosis may not be necessary at this point. It is important to gather more information through the skin biopsy before starting systemic therapy.

No medical image is required to answer this question.",A,"The correct answer is: Obtain a skin biopsy of the affected area on the left shin and apply a topical antibiotic to both the perianal area and the shin area until the pathology result is available.

Explanation: The patient has multiple sclerosis and has been receiving treatment with rituximab, which can suppress the immune system. He has developed skin lesions that are tender and have not responded to the cream prescribed by his physician. Given his medical history and the appearance of the lesions, it is important to obtain a skin biopsy to determine the cause of the rash. In the meantime, a topical antibiotic should be applied to both the perianal area and the shin area to prevent infection. It is not necessary to obtain bacterial or fungal cultures or to start systemic antibiotics or antifungal agents without first determining the cause of the lesions.",D,"Based on the information provided, I would choose option 4: Obtain fungal culture from both affected areas and initiate systemic antifungal therapy.

The patient's symptoms of tender skin eruptions adjacent to the anus and on the left shin, along with the absence of fevers or chills, suggest a possible fungal infection. The fact that the patient has been using a combination cream of betamethasone diproprionate and clotrimazole, which is commonly used to treat fungal infections, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of multiple sclerosis and recent treatment with rituximab, which can weaken the immune system, increases the likelihood of a fungal infection.

Therefore, it would be appropriate to obtain fungal cultures from both affected areas to confirm the diagnosis. If the cultures are positive for a fungal infection, systemic antifungal therapy should be initiated.

Justification for the answer:

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a possible fungal infection. Fungal cultures are the gold standard for diagnosing fungal infections, and systemic antifungal therapy is the appropriate treatment if the cultures are positive. Obtaining bacterial cultures may also be useful, but it is less likely that a bacterial infection is causing the patient's symptoms given the absence of fevers or chills. A skin biopsy may also be useful, but it is not as urgent as obtaining fungal cultures and initiating antifungal therapy, given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Justify if the question above need the corresponding medical image, please just answer <True> or <False>.

True.

The question does require a medical image, such as a photograph or drawing of the affected areas, to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's skin eruptions. This would help the doctor to better assess the severity and extent of the lesions, and to determine if there are any other signs of infection or inflammation that may not be immediately apparent from the patient's symptoms and medical history.",jama
